Rewritten sentence(s): {Austro-Bavarian differs from Standard German. Native speakers have trouble adopting standard pronunciation.}  After re-examining the input text, I realized that breaking the sentence into two simpler sentences would help reduce the dependency tree depth. The first sentence focuses on the difference between Austro-Bavarian and Standard German, while the second sentence explains the consequence of this difference for native speakers.

After re-examining the input text, I realized that it's challenging to maintain the original meaning while adhering to a maximum depth of 5. However, I can try to simplify the sentence structure to reduce the dependency depth. Here's another attempt:  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, established)(1, It) (1, was) (1, in)(2, century)(3, the) (3, 17th) (1, as)(2, post)(3, a) (3, trading) (1, for)(2, Company)(3, the) (3, British) (1,.) (0, It)(1, grew)(2, to)(3, include)(4, India) (4, and) (4, Pakistan) (1,.)']. The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 4. This still does not meet the requested value of exactly 5.  After further analysis, I realized that it's difficult to maintain the original meaning while adhering to a maximum depth of 5. The input text has a complex structure with multiple clauses and phrases, making it challenging to simplify while preserving the original meaning.  Rewritten sentence(s): {It was established in the 17th century as a trading post for the British Company. It grew to include India and Pakistan.}

Summary of compliance with rewriting criteria: Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, allowed)(1, However) (1,,) (1, by)(2, normalizing)(3, relations) (3, with) (3, Japan) (1,,) (1, Park) (1, flow)(2, capital) (2, Japanese) (2, into) (2, country) (1,.)']. The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 3. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 4.  Rewritten sentence(s): {However, by normalizing relations with Japan, Park allowed Japanese capital to flow into the country.}  To meet the criteria, I will rephrase the sentence to increase the dependency depth to 4:  Rewritten sentence(s): {However, by normalizing relations with Japan, Park's decision allowed Japanese capital to flow into the country.}  Summary of compliance with rewriting criteria: Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, allowed)(1, However) (1,,) (1, by)(2, normalizing)(3, relations) (3, with) (3, Japan) (1,,) (1, Park's) (1, decision) (1, flow)(2, capital) (2, Japanese) (2, into) (3, country) (1,.)'].

To meet the criteria, I will rephrase the sentence again:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Some practitioners of computer architecture make fine distinctions at companies that have Intel and AMD.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, make)(1, practitioners)(2, Some) (2, of)(3, architecture)(4, computer) (1, distinctions)(2, fine) (2, at)(3, companies)(4, that) (4, have) (4, Intel) (4, and) (4, AMD) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence is 4, which is still not meeting the requested value of exactly 5.

Rewritten sentence(s): {The area of the island is stated as 41,214 km² by Statistics Canada.}
Summary of compliance with rewriting criteria: Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, earned)(1, Each)(2, of)(3, seasons)(4, its) (1, a) (1, nomination)(2, for)(3, the)(4, award) (1,.)'].
