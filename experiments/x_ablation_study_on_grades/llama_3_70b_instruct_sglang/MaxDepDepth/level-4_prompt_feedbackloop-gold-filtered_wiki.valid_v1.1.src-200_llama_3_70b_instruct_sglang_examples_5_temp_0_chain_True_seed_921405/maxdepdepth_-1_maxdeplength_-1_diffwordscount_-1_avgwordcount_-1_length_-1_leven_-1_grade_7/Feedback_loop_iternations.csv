After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to maintain its original meaning while adhering to a maximum depth of the dependency tree of exactly 6. The original sentence has a complex structure, and breaking it down into simpler sentences would alter its meaning.  However, I can provide a rewritten sentence that maintains the original meaning and has a maximum dependency depth close to 6:  Rewritten sentence(s): {The authors from the Sil Valley, specifically from El Bierzu in Llión, have contributed to a collective book.
