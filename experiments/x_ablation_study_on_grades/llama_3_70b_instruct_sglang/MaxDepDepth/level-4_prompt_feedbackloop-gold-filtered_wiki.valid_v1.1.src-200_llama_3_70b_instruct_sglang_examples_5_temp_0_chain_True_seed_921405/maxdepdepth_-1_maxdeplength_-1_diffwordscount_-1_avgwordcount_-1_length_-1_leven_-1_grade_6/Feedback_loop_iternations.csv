line_number, 125, iternation, 10, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to rewrite the sentence to meet the exact maximum dependency tree depth of 5. I will continue to revise the sentence until it meets the criteria.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to maintain its original meaning while adhering to a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 5. The original sentence has a complex structure with multiple clauses and phrases, making it difficult to simplify while preserving the same level of detail.  If you would like, I can try to provide a rewritten sentence that approximates the original meaning while meeting the maximum dependency tree depth of 5. Alternatively, I can provide a rewritten sentence that breaks the original sentence into simpler sentences, each with a lower dependency tree depth.  Please let me know how I can proceed.
