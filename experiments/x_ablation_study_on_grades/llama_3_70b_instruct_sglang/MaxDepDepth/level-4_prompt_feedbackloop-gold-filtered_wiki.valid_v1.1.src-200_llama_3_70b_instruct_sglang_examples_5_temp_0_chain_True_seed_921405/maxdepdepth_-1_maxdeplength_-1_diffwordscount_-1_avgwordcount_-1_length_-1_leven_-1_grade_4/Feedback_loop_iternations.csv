After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to reduce the dependency tree depth to exactly 5 while maintaining the original meaning. However, I'll keep trying to find a solution.  If you would like, I can try to provide a rewritten sentence with a dependency tree depth of 5 or less, even if it means rephrasing the sentence to convey a similar meaning. Please let me know if that's an acceptable approach.  Alternatively, I can continue to try to find a rewritten sentence that meets the original criteria. Please let me know how I should proceed.
