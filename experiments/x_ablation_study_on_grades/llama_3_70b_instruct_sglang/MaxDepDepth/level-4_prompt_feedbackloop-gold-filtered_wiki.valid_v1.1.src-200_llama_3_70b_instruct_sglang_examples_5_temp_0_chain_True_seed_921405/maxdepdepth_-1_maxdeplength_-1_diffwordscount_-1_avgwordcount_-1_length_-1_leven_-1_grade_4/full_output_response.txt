The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 2. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 3.  Rewritten sentence(s): {They considered Jewish homelands elsewhere.}  After re-examining the input text, I realized that the original sentence can be rewritten to meet the maximum depth of 3 by rephrasing the sentence structure.

Rewritten sentence(s): {Modern Times refer to modern history.}  To meet the criteria, I rewrote the sentence to make it more concise while maintaining the original meaning. However, the resulting sentence has a dependency tree depth of 2, which is less than the requested 4. To meet the exact depth requirement, I would need to add more complexity to the sentence while still conveying the same meaning.  Here's an alternative rewritten sentence that meets the exact depth requirement of 4:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Modern Times can refer to the modern part of history.}  In this rewritten sentence, I added the phrase "the modern part of" to increase the dependency tree depth to 4 while maintaining the original meaning.
