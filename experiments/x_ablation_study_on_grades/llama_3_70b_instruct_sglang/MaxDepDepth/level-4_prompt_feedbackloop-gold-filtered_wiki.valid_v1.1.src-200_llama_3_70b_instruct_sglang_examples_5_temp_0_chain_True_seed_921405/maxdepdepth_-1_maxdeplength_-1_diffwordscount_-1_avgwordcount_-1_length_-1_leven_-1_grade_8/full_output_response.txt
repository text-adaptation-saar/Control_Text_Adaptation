The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 4. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 5.  After re-examining the input text, I realized that it's challenging to maintain the original meaning while adhering to a maximum depth of 5. However, I can try to simplify the sentence structure to reduce the dependency depth. Here's another attempt:  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, mentioned)(1, It) (1, was) (1, in)(2, 1233) (2, in)(3, deed) (2, of)(3, King) (3, Andrew) (1,.)'].

Rewritten sentence(s): {He played baseball as a second baseman for the champion Rosedales in Manitoba.}  After re-examining the input text, I realized that the original sentence is already quite simple and concise. To meet the requirement of a maximum dependency depth of 6, I would need to rephrase the sentence to introduce more complexity while maintaining the original meaning. Here's another attempt:  Rewritten sentence(s): {He was a second baseman for the Rosedales, a provincial champion team in Manitoba, and played baseball.}  This rewritten sentence has a Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree of: ['(0, was)(1, He) (1, baseman)(2, second) (1, for)(2, Rosedales)(3, the) (1,,) (1, and)(2, played)(3, baseball) (2,,) (2, team)(3, champion) (3, provincial) (3, in)(4, Manitoba) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for this rewritten sentence is 4, which still does not meet the requested value of exactly 6.

I apologize for the mistake. I will continue to revise the sentence until it meets the criteria. However, I must admit that it's challenging to increase the dependency tree depth to exactly 6 while maintaining the original meaning.

Alternatively, I can try to provide a sentence with a dependency tree depth of 5 or 7, which might be more feasible.  Please let me know how to proceed.
