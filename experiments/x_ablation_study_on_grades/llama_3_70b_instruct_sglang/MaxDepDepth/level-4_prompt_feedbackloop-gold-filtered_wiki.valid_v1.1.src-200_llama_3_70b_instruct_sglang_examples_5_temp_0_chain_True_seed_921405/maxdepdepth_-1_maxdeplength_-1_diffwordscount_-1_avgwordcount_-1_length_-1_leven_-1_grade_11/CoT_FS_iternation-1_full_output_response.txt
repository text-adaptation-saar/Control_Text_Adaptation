The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 3. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 4.  To meet the criteria, I will try to rephrase the sentence to increase the dependency depth to 4:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Anita is a city located in Cass County of Iowa, United States.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, is)(1, Anita) (1, city)(2, a) (2, located)(3, in)(4, States) (3, United) (2, of)(3, Iowa) (2, County)(3, Cass) (1,.)'].

Rewritten sentence(s): {This uses an mRNA sequence as a template to guide the synthesis of amino acids into protein.}  After re-examining the input text, I realized that the original sentence is quite complex and requires significant rephrasing to meet the maximum dependency depth of 8. Here's another attempt:  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, uses)(1, This) (1, mRNA)(2, an) (2, sequence) (1, as)(2, template) (2, for)(3, synthesizing) (3, a) (3, chain) (3, of)(4, amino) (4, acids) (3, that)(4, forms) (4, a) (4, protein) (1,.)'].

The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 3. This still does not meet the requested value of exactly 8.  After multiple attempts, I realized that it's challenging to rephrase the original sentence to meet the maximum dependency depth of 8 while maintaining its original meaning. The sentence structure and complexity require significant reorganization to meet the requested criteria.  Rewritten sentence(s): {This uses an mRNA sequence as a template for synthesizing amino acids into a chain that forms a protein. It guides the synthesis of this chain.}

The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 5. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 7.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to maintain the original meaning while adhering to a maximum depth of 7. However, I can try to simplify the sentence to reduce the dependency depth. Here's another attempt:  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ["(0, called)(1, In)(2, July) (1,,) (1, he) (1, was) (1, testify)(2, to) (2, Committee) (2, on)(3, Un-American) (3, Activities) (2, about)(3, Robeson) (3, Paul) (2,.)"] The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 3. This still does not meet the requested value of exactly 7.  After further analysis, I realized that it's difficult to maintain the original meaning while adhering to a maximum depth of 7.
