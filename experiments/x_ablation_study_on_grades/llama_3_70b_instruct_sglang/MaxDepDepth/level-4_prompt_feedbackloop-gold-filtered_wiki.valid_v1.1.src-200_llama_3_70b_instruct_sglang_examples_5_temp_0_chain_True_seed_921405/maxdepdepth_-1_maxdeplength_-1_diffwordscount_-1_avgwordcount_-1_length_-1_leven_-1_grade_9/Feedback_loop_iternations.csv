"Mercury has a freezing point." - This sentence has a dependency depth of 2. 2. "It is â '38.83 Â C." - This sentence has a dependency depth of 3. 3. "Mercury has a boiling point." - This sentence has a dependency depth of 2. 4. "It is 356.73 Â C." - This sentence has a dependency depth of 3. 5. "Mercury has a broad liquid range." - This sentence has a dependency depth of 3. 6. "It is a metal." - This sentence has a dependency depth of 2.  By breaking down the original sentence into these six simpler sentences, I was able to reduce the maximum dependency depth to 4, meeting the required criteria.

After re-examining the input text, I realized that it's challenging to reduce the dependency tree depth to exactly 5 while maintaining the original meaning. However, I can try to simplify the sentence to reduce the dependency tree depth. Here's another attempt:  Rewritten sentence(s): {The Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament in India, held its first sitting in 1952, with members from various states.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, held)(1, The) (1, Sabha)(2, Rajya) (2,,) (2, house)(3, the) (3, upper) (3, of)(4, the) (4, Parliament) (4, in) (4, India) (2,,) (1, sitting)(2, its) (2, first) (1, in) (1, 1952) (1,,) (1, with) (1, members)(2, from) (2, various) (2, states) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 4. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 5.  I will continue to revise the sentence until it meets the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 5. If you'd like, I can try to further modify the sentence to meet the exact requirement.
