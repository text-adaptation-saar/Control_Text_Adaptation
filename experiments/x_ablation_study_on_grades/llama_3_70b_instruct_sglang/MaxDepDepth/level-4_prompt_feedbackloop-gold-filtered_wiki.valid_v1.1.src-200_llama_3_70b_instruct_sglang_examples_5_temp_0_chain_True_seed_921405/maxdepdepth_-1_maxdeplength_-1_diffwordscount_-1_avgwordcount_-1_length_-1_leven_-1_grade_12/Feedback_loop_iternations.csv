This does not meet the requested value of exactly 6. I will continue to revise the sentence until it meets the criteria.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to maintain the original meaning while adhering to a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 6. The sentence structure and wording need to be significantly altered to meet this requirement. Here is another attempt:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Baader, born in Munich, was a high school dropout and a criminal who got involved with the RAF.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, Baader)(1, born)(2, in)(3, Munich)(3,,) (3, was)(4, dropout)(5, a) (5, school)(6, high) (4, and) (4, a) (4, criminal) (3, who) (4, got)(5, involved)(6, with) (5, the) (5, RAF) (3,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 6.
