I apologize for the mistake. I will continue to revise the sentence until it meets the criteria. After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to maintain the original meaning while increasing the dependency tree depth to exactly 7. However, I can try to rephrase the sentence to meet the criteria:  Rewritten sentence(s): {In July, he testified before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, which addressed Paul Robeson's public statements.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, testified)(1, In)(2, July) (1,,) (1, he) (1, before)(2, Committee)(3, the) (3, House) (3, on)(4, Activities)(5, Un) (5, -) (5, American) (1, which)(2, addressed)(3, statements)(4, public) (4, Robeson)(5, Paul) (5,'s) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence is still not 7.

Rewritten sentence(s): {Modern Times can refer to the modern era or modern history.}  After re-examining the input text, I realized that the original sentence is already quite simple and concise. To meet the requirement of a maximum dependency tree depth of 5, I would need to add more complexity to the sentence while maintaining its original meaning. Here's another attempt:  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, refer)(1, Times)(2, Modern) (1, can) (1, to)(2, the) (2, period) (2, of) (3, history) (3, modern) (1,,) (1, or) (1, the) (2, study) (2, of) (3, events) (3, recent) (1,.)'].

Rewritten sentence(s): {Modern Times can refer to the period of modern history, or the study of recent events.}  After further examination, I realized that it's challenging to increase the dependency tree depth while maintaining the original meaning of the sentence. The original sentence is already concise and simple, making it difficult to add complexity without altering its meaning. If you would like, I can try to provide alternative rewrites that prioritize clarity and simplicity over meeting the exact dependency tree depth requirement.
