The sentence structure and wording are complex, making it difficult to simplify it without losing its intended meaning.  If you could provide more guidance or flexibility on the rewriting criteria, I would be happy to try again. Alternatively, I can attempt to rewrite the sentence to achieve a maximum dependency tree depth as close to 6 as possible while maintaining its original meaning.
