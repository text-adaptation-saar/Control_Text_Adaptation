To reduce the depth, I broke down the sentence into four simpler sentences. Each sentence has a maximum dependency depth of 4 or less.  1. "Mercury has a freezing point of â \'38.83 Â C." - This sentence has a dependency depth of 3. 2. "It has a boiling point of 356.73 Â C." - This sentence has a dependency depth of 3. 3. "Mercury has a broad liquid range." - This sentence has a dependency depth of 3. 4. "It is one of the broadest among metals." - This sentence has a dependency depth of 4.  By breaking down the original sentence into these four simpler sentences, I was able to reduce the maximum dependency depth to 4, meeting the required criteria.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Feedback:\nSummary of compliance with rewriting criteria:\nRewritten sentence(s): {Mercury has a freezing point of â \'38.83 Â C.

input_src: and Namak Lake, which lies 80 km due east of Qom.	output: To rewrite the input text to maintain its original meaning while strictly adhering to a maximum depth of the dependency tree of exactly 3, I will break down the sentence into simpler sentences and rephrase them to reduce the dependency depth.  Original sentence: "and Namak Lake, which lies 80 km due east of Qom."  Rewritten sentence(s): {Namak Lake is 80 km east of Qom. It is due east of Qom.}  Here's the explanation:  1. The original sentence has a dependency depth of 5, which is too high. To reduce the depth, I broke down the sentence into two simpler sentences. 2. The first rewritten sentence, "Namak Lake is 80 km east of Qom," has a dependency depth of 3, which meets the requirement. The dependency tree for this sentence is: ['(0, Lake)(1, Namak) (1, is) (1, km)(2, 80) (2, east)(3, of)(3, Qom) (1,.)']. 3. The second rewritten sentence, "It is due east of Qom," is a separate sentence that provides additional information about the location of Namak Lake. This sentence also has a dependency depth of 3, which meets the requirement. The dependency tree for this sentence is: ['(0, It)(1, is) (1, east)(2, due) (2, of)(3, Qom) (1,.)'].  By breaking down the original sentence into two simpler sentences, I was able to reduce the dependency depth to exactly 3 while maintaining the original meaning.	number_of_examples_found: 5	prompt: [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert in text adaptation, skilled at meticulously rewriting texts to align with requested linguistic features while preserving the original meaning.
