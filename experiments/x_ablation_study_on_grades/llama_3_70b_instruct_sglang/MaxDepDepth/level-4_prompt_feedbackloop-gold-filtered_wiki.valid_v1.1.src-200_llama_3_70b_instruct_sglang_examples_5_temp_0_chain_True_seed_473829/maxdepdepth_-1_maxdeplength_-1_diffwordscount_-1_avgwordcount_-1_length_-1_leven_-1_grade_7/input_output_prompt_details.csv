input_src: Tropical Storm Delta was a late-forming tropical storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season which struck the Canary Islands as a strong extratropical storm causing significant damage and then crossed over Morocco with little impact there.	output: I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to achieve a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 5 with the previous rewrites. I will continue to revise the sentence until it meets the requested criteria.  Could you please provide more guidance or examples of how to achieve a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 5? This will help me to better understand the requirements and generate a rewritten sentence that meets the criteria.  Alternatively, I can try to break down the sentence into smaller parts and rephrase them to achieve a lower dependency tree depth. However, this may affect the original meaning and clarity of the sentence.  Please let me know how I can proceed to meet the requirements.
