However, I want to clarify that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to exactly 6 levels of dependency depth while maintaining the original meaning and grammatical correctness.  Could you please provide more guidance or flexibility on the rewriting criteria, such as allowing a range of dependency depths (e.g., 5-7) or providing more context about the sentence's purpose and audience? This would help me to better understand the requirements and generate a rewritten sentence that meets the criteria.  If not, I can continue to try rewriting the sentence to exactly 6 levels of dependency depth, but I may need to make significant changes to the sentence structure and wording, which may affect its original meaning and clarity.
