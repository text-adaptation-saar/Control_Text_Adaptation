The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 2. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 4.  Rewritten sentence(s): {Modern Times refer to modern history.}  To meet the criteria, I rewrote the sentence to make it simpler and reduce the dependency depth. However, the resulting sentence still has a depth of 2, which is less than the requested 4. To meet the exact depth of 4, I would need to add more complexity to the sentence while maintaining its original meaning. Here's another attempt:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Modern Times can refer to the modern part of history.}  Summary of compliance with rewriting criteria: Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, refer)(1, can) (1, Times) (1, Modern) (1, to) (2, part) (2, modern) (2, of) (3, history) (1,.)']. The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 3. This is still short of the requested value of exactly 4.
