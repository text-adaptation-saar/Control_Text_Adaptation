line_number, 5, iternation, 3, response, I apologize for the mistake. After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rephrase it to exactly meet the maximum dependency tree depth of 5 while maintaining the original meaning. The sentence structure and wording do not allow for a natural rephrasing that meets this specific requirement.  However, I'll continue to try and find an alternative solution. If you'd like, I can attempt to rewrite the sentence to simplify its structure and reduce the dependency tree depth, even if it doesn't exactly meet the target of 5. Please let me know if that's acceptable.  Alternatively, I can also provide a detailed explanation of why it's challenging to rephrase the sentence to meet the exact dependency tree depth of 5, and we can discuss possible alternatives or adjustments to the requirements.
