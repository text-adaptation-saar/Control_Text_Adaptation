line_number, 55, iternation, 1, response, I apologize for the mistake. Here is a revised version of the rewritten sentence(s) with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 4:  Rewritten sentence(s): {This uses mRNA as a template. It guides protein synthesis.}  Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max(['(0, uses)(1, This) (1, mRNA) (1, as)(2, template)(3, a) (1,.)', '(0, guides)(1, It) (1, synthesis)(2, protein) (1,.)']) = 3.  Since the rewritten sentence(s) still do not meet the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 4, I will revise them again:  Rewritten sentence(s): {This uses mRNA as a template.

After re-examining the input text, I realized that the original sentence can be broken down into two simpler sentences, each with a maximum dependency depth of 4. Here is the revised version:  Rewritten sentence(s): {This uses mRNA as a template to guide.
