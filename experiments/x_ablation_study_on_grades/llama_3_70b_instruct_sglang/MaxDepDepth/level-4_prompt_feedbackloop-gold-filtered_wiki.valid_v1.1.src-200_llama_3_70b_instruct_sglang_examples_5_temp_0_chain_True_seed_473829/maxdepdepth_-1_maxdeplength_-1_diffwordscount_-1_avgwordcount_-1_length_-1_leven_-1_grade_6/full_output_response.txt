Here is a revised version of the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 5:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Some practitioners of computer architecture at companies use finer distinctions like Intel's and AMD's.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, use)(1, practitioners)(2, Some) (2, of)(3, architecture)(4, computer) (2, at)(3, companies) (1, distinctions)(2, finer) (3, like) (4, Intel's) (4, and) (4, AMD's) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence is 4, which is close to the requested value of exactly 5. To meet the requirement, I can rephrase the sentence slightly:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Some practitioners of computer architecture at companies use finer distinctions, including Intel's and AMD's.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, use)(1, practitioners)(2, Some) (2, of)(3, architecture)(4, computer) (2, at)(3, companies) (1, distinctions)(2, finer) (3, including) (4, Intel's) (4, and) (4, AMD's) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence is 4, still not meeting the requested criteria. After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rephrase the sentence to meet the exact maximum dependency tree depth of 5 while maintaining the original meaning. I will continue to try to find a suitable solution.
