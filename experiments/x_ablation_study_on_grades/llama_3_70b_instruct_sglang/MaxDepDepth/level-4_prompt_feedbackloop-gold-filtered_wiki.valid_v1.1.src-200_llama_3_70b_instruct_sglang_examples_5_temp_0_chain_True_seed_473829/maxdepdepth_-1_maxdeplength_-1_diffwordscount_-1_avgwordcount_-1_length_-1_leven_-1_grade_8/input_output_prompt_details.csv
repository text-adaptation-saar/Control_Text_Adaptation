input_src: Matilda of Flanders (c. 1031 - 2 November 1083) was the wife of William the Conqueror and, as such, Queen consort of the Kingdom of England.	output: I apologize for the mistake. After re-examining the input text, I realized that it's challenging to rephrase the sentence to meet the maximum dependency depth of exactly 5 while maintaining the original meaning. The sentence structure and word choice are crucial in determining the dependency depth.  To meet the maximum dependency depth of exactly 5, I will attempt to rephrase the sentence again:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Matilda of Flanders was born around 1031 and died 1083. She was the wife of William the Conqueror and Queen. She ruled England's Kingdom.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, was)(1, Matilda)(2, of)(3, Flanders) (1, born)(2, around)(3, 1031) (1, and)(2, died)(3, 1083) (1,.)', '(0, was)(1, She) (1, wife)(2, the) (2, of)(3, William)(4, Conqueror) (1, and)(2, Queen) (1,.)', '(0, ruled)(1, She) (1, England)(2,'s) (2, Kingdom) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence is still 4. I will continue to revise the sentence until it meets the maximum dependency depth of exactly 5.
