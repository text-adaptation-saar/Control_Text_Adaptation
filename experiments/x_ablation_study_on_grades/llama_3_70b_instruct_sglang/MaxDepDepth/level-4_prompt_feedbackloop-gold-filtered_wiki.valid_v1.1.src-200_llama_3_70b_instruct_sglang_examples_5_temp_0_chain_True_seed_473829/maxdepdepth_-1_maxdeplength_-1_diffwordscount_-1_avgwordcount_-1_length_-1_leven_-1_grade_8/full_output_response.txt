I apologize for the mistake. Here is a revised version of the rewritten sentence that meets the maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 4:  Rewritten sentence(s): {The Province of Bari is in Apulia region. Its capital is Bari City in Italy.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, is)(1, Province)(2, The) (2, of)(3, Bari) (1, in) (2, region) (3, Apulia) (1,.)', '(0, is)(1, capital)(2, Its) (1, Bari) (2, City) (2, in) (3, Italy) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence is 3, which is still not meeting the requested value of exactly 4. I will continue to revise the sentence to meet the requirements.  After re-examining the input text, I realized that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to meet the exact maximum dependency tree depth of 4 while maintaining the original meaning. However, I can try to get closer to the requested value.  Rewritten sentence(s): {The Province of Bari is in a region of Apulia. Its capital is Bari City in Italy.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, is)(1, Province)(2, The) (2, of)(3, Bari) (1, in) (2, a) (2, region) (3, of) (4, Apulia) (1,.)', '(0, is)(1, capital)(2, Its) (1, Bari) (2, City) (2, in) (3, Italy) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence is 4, which meets the requested value of exactly 4.
I apologize for the mistake.

I removed the phrase "located" to reduce the dependency depth. 2. I added the phrase "of northern" to maintain the original meaning and reduce the dependency depth to 9.  The Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree for the rewritten sentence is: ['(0, is)(1, Quercamps) (1, commune)(2, in)(3, department)(4, the) (4, Pas) (4, -) (4, de) (4, -) (4, Calais) (3, which) (4, is)(5, in)(6, region)(7, the) (7, Nord) (7, -) (7, Pas) (7, -) (7, de) (7, -) (7, Calais) (7, of)(8, northern) (8, France) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence is 8, which is still not meeting the requested value of exactly 9.

I apologize for the mistake. After re-examining the input text, I realized that it's challenging to rephrase the sentence to meet the maximum dependency depth of exactly 5 while maintaining the original meaning. The sentence structure and word choice are crucial in determining the dependency depth.  To meet the maximum dependency depth of exactly 5, I will attempt to rephrase the sentence again:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Matilda of Flanders was born around 1031 and died 1083.

Then, an eight-year reconstruction project began, which transformed the theatre's architecture and design. In 1990, the theatre was officially reopened as the Estates Theatre, marking a new era in its history with a focus on cultural excellence.}  Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = 6.  I hope this revised rewritten sentence meets the requirements.
