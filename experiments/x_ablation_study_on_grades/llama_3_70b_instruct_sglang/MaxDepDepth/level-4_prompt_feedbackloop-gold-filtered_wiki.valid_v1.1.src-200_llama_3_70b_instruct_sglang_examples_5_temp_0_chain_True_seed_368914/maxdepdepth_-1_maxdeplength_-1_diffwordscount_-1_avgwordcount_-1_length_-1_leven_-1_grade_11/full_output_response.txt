This does not meet the requested value of exactly 4.  To meet the criteria, I will try to rephrase the sentence to increase the dependency depth to 4:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Anita is a city that has Cass Iowa.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, is)(1, Anita) (1, city)(2, a) (2, that)(3, has) (3, Iowa) (3, Cass) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 3.

The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 4. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 8.  Rewritten sentence(s): {This uses an mRNA sequence as a template to guide the synthesis of amino acids into protein.}  After re-examining the input text, I realized that the original sentence is quite complex and requires significant rephrasing to meet the maximum dependency depth of 8. Here's another attempt:  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, uses)(1, This) (1, mRNA)(2, an) (2, sequence) (1, as)(2, template) (2, for)(3, synthesizing) (3, a) (3, chain) (3, of)(4, amino) (4, acids) (3, that)(4, forms) (4, a) (4, protein) (1,.)']. The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 4. This still does not meet the requested value of exactly 8.  After further rephrasing, I arrived at the following rewritten sentence:  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, uses)(1, This) (1, mRNA)(2, an) (2, sequence) (1, as)(2, template) (2, for)(3, synthesizing) (3, a) (3, chain) (3, composed)(4, of) (4, amino) (4, acids) (3, which)(4, forms) (4, a) (4, protein) (1,.)']. The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 4. This still does not meet the requested value of exactly 8.  After multiple attempts, I realized that it's challenging to rephrase the original sentence to meet the maximum dependency depth of 8 while maintaining its original meaning. The sentence structure and wording are inherently complex, making it difficult to simplify without losing essential information.  If you would like, I can try to rephrase the sentence again or provide alternative solutions that may not meet the exact dependency depth requirement but still convey the original meaning.
