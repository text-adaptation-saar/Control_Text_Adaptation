After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to meet the exact maximum dependency tree depth of 4 while maintaining the original meaning. The sentence structure and word choice are limiting the ability to reduce the dependency tree depth.  However, I will continue to try to find a solution. Here is a revised version of the sentence:  Rewritten sentence(s): {The inhabitants were affected by an earthquake in a region on October 8, 2005.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, affected)(1, inhabitants)(2, The) (1, were) (1, by)(2, earthquake)(3, an) (1, in) (2, region) (1, on) (2, October) (2, 8) (2, 2005) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence is still 3, which is not meeting the requested value of exactly 4. I will continue to revise the sentence until it meets the requested criteria.  If you could provide more context or relax the constraint on the maximum dependency tree depth, I would be happy to assist you in rewriting the sentence.

After several attempts, I realized that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to meet the exact maximum dependency tree depth of 3 while maintaining the original meaning. The sentence structure and word choice are limited, making it difficult to achieve the desired depth.  If you could provide more context or relax the constraint, I'd be happy to help you find an alternative solution.
