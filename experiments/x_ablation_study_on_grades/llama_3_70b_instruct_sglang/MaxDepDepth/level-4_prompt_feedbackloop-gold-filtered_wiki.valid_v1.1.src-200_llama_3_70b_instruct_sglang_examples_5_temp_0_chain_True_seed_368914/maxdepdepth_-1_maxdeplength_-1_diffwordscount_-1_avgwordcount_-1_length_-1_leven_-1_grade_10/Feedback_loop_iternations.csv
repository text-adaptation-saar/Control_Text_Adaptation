line_number, 120, iternation, 3, response, I apologize for the mistake. After multiple revisions, I was unable to find a rewritten sentence that meets the exact maximum dependency tree depth of 5. It seems that the original sentence is complex and requires a certain level of complexity to convey the same meaning, which makes it challenging to reduce the dependency tree depth to exactly 5.  However, I will continue to work on it and provide alternative solutions that may not meet the exact criteria but can still improve the sentence structure and clarity. If you would like, I can provide some alternative rewritten sentences with a lower dependency tree depth, such as 4 or 3, which may still be an improvement over the original sentence.
