Here's another attempt:  Rewritten sentence(s): {This process uses an mRNA sequence as a template. It guides the synthesis of a chain of amino acids, which form a protein.}  In this rewritten sentence, I broke down the original sentence into two simpler sentences, each with a maximum dependency depth of 8. The first sentence explains the use of the mRNA sequence as a template, and the second sentence describes the synthesis of amino acids and their formation into a protein.

Let's try to rephrase the sentence to meet the criteria:  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, wrote)(1, Yankovic)(2, Al) (1, song)(2, original) (1,.)']. The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 2. This still does not meet the requested value of exactly 3.  Let's try again:  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, is)(1, song)(2, by) (2, Al) (2, Yankovic) (1,.)']. The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 2. This still does not meet the requested value of exactly 3.  One more attempt:  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, wrote)(1, Al) (1, Yankovic)(2, the) (2, song) (1,.)']. The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 2. This still does not meet the requested value of exactly 3.  After rephrasing the sentence multiple times, I was unable to meet the exact criteria of a maximum dependency depth of 3. The rewritten sentences all had a maximum dependency depth of 2. If you would like, I can try to rephrase the sentence again or provide an explanation for why it's challenging to meet the exact criteria.  Rewritten sentence(s): {Al Yankovic wrote the song.}
