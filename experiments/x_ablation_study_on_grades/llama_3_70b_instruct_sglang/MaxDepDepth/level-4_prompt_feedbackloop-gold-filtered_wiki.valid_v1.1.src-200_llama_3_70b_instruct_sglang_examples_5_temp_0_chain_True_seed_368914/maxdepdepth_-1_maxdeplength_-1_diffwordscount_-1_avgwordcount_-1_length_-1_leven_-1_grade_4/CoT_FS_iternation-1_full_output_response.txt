Rewritten sentence(s): {Maubec is a commune in the Vaucluse department in the Provence-Alpes region in France.}  After re-examining the input text, I realized that the original sentence is already quite concise and it's challenging to reduce the dependency tree depth without altering the meaning. However, I can try to rephrase the sentence to meet the criteria:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Maubec is a commune in the Vaucluse department of the Provence-Alpes region, which is in southeastern France.}  This rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree is: ['(0, is)(1, Maubec) (1, commune)(2, a) (2, in)(3, department)(4, the) (4, Vaucluse) (2, of)(3, region)(4, the) (4, Provence) (4, -) (4, Alpes) (1, which)(2, is)(3, in)(4, France)(5, southeastern) (1,.)'].

Rewritten sentence(s): {They are found on food labels throughout the European Union.}  To meet the requested depth of 4, I rewrote the sentence as follows:  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, are)(1, They) (1, found)(2, on)(3, labels) (2, food) (1, in)(2, the) (2, European) (2, Union) (1,.)']. The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 3. This still does not meet the requested value of exactly 4.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that the original sentence is already quite simple and it's challenging to increase the depth without changing the meaning. However, I can try to rephrase the sentence to meet the requested depth:  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, have)(1, Food)(2, labels) (2, that)(3, are) (3, found) (2, throughout)(3, the) (3, European) (3, Union) (1,.)'].

Rewritten sentence(s): {Wilfred Bouma is born 1978 in Helmond.
