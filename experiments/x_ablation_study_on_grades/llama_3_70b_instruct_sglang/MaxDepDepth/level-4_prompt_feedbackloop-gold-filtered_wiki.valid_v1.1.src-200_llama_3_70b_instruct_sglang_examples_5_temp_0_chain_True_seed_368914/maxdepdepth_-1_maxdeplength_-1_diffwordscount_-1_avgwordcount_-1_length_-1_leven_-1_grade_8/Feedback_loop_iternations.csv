Here is a revised rewritten sentence that meets the maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 9:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Quercamps is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department, which is in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region in northern France.}  Here's the explanation:  1.

I will continue to revise the sentence until it meets the requested criteria.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rewrite it to exactly 5 levels of dependency without changing the meaning or structure significantly. However, I can try to rephrase it to make it simpler while maintaining the original meaning:  Rewritten sentence(s): {The London County Council Tramways became part of the London Passenger Transport Board on 1 July 1933, also known as London Transport.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, became)(1, The) (1, Tramways)(2, Council)(3, County)(4, London) (1, part)(2, of)(3, the) (3, London) (3, Passenger) (3, Transport) (3, Board) (1, on) (2, 1) (2, July) (2, 1933) (1,,) (1, also) (2, known) (3, as) (4, London) (4, Transport) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for this rewritten sentence is still not 5. I will continue to revise the sentence until it meets the requested criteria.  If you could provide more guidance or clarification on how to achieve a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 5, I would appreciate it.

line_number, 199, iternation, 1, response, I apologize for the mistake. Here is a revised attempt to rewrite the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 6:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Marguerite Louise was the daughter of Gaston de France. She had to surrender her rights as Princess of France in Cosimo's contract.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, was)(1, Louise)(2, Marguerite) (1, daughter)(2, the) (2, of)(3, France)(4, Gaston) (4, de) (1,.)', '(0, had)(1, She) (1, to) (2, surrender) (2, her) (2, rights) (3, as) (3, Princess) (4, of) (4, France) (1, in) (2, contract)(3, Cosimo)(4,'s) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence is 4. I will continue to revise until the criteria are met.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rephrase the original sentence to meet the maximum depth of 6 while maintaining its original meaning. The sentence is inherently complex, and breaking it down into simpler sentences would alter its meaning.  However, I will try to rephrase the sentence again to meet the maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 6:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Marguerite Louise, daughter of Gaston de France, Duke of OrlÃ ans, surrendered her rights as Princess of France in Cosimo's contract.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, surrendered)(1, Louise)(2, Marguerite) (2, daughter)(3, of)(4, France)(5, Gaston) (5, de) (5,,) (5, Duke)(6, of)(6, ans)(7, OrlÃ) (1, her) (1, rights) (2, as) (2, Princess) (3, of) (3, France) (1, in) (2, contract)(3, Cosimo)(4,'s) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence is 7. I will continue to revise until the criteria are met.  After further re-examination, I realized that it's challenging to rephrase the original sentence to meet the maximum depth of 6 while maintaining its original meaning. The sentence is inherently complex, and breaking it down into simpler sentences would alter its meaning.  If you would like, I can try to rephrase the sentence again or provide alternative solutions.

line_number, 199, iternation, 6, response, I apologize for the mistake. I will continue to revise until the criteria are met. However, I must admit that it's challenging to rephrase the original sentence to meet the maximum depth of 6 while maintaining its original meaning. The sentence is inherently complex, and breaking it down into simpler sentences would alter its meaning.  If you would like, I can try to rephrase the sentence again or provide alternative solutions. Alternatively, I can also discuss with you the possibility of revising the original sentence to make it more amenable to rewriting with a maximum dependency tree depth of 6.  Please let me know how I can proceed.
