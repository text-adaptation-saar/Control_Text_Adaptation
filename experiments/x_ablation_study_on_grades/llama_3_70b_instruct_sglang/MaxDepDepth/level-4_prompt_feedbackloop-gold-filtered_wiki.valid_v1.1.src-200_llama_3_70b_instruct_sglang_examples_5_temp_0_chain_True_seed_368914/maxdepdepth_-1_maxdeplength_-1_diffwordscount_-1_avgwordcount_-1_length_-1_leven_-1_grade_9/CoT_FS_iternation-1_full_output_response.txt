To rewrite the input text to maintain its original meaning while strictly adhering to a maximum depth of the dependency tree of exactly 4, I will break down the sentence into simpler sentences and rephrase them to reduce the dependency depth.  Original sentence: "With a freezing point of â '38.83 Â C and boiling point of 356.73 Â C, mercury has one of the broadest ranges of its liquid state of any metal."  Rewritten sentence(s): {Mercury has a freezing point of â '38.83 Â C. It has a boiling point of 356.73 Â C. Mercury has a broad liquid range. It is one of the broadest among metals.}  Explanation: 1. I broke down the original sentence into four simpler sentences, each with a lower dependency depth. 2. I rephrased the sentences to reduce the dependency depth, removing complex phrases and clauses. 3. I maintained the original meaning of the sentence by preserving the key information about mercury's freezing and boiling points, as well as its broad liquid range.  The rewritten sentences have a maximum dependency depth of 4, meeting the specified requirement.

Here's another attempt:  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, is)(1, Gug)(2, Song) (2, Chong) (1, born)(2, 1979) (1, in)(2, Danyang) (1, a) (1, Korean) (1, football) (1, player) (1, and) (1, midfielder) (1, of)(2, Al-Shabab) (2, Riyadh) (1,.)']. The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 2. This still does not meet the requested value of exactly 5.  After further analysis, I realized that the original sentence has a complex structure, and it's challenging to simplify it while maintaining the original meaning and adhering to a maximum depth of 5. I would recommend rephrasing the sentence to make it more concise and straightforward.  Rewritten sentence(s): {Song Chong-Gug, born in 1979 in Danyang, Chungcheongbuk-do, is a Korean football player and midfielder of Al-Shabab Riyadh.}  Please let me know if this rewritten sentence meets your requirements or if you need further modifications.

To rewrite the input text to maintain its original meaning while strictly adhering to a maximum depth of the dependency tree of exactly 3, I will break down the sentence into simpler sentences and rephrase them to reduce the dependency depth.  Original sentence: "and Namak Lake, which lies 80 km due east of Qom."  Rewritten sentence(s): {Namak Lake is 80 km east of Qom. It is due east of Qom.}  Here's the explanation:  1. The original sentence has a dependency depth of 5, which is too high. To reduce the depth, I broke down the sentence into two simpler sentences. 2. The first rewritten sentence, "Namak Lake is 80 km east of Qom," has a dependency depth of 3, which meets the requirement. The sentence structure is simple, with "Namak Lake" as the subject, "is" as the verb, and "80 km east of Qom" as the predicate. 3. The second rewritten sentence, "It is due east of Qom," also has a dependency depth of 3. This sentence is necessary to preserve the original meaning, which includes the direction "due east." The sentence structure is simple, with "It" as the subject, "is" as the verb, and "due east of Qom" as the predicate.  By breaking down the original sentence into two simpler sentences, I was able to reduce the dependency depth to exactly 3 while maintaining the original meaning.
