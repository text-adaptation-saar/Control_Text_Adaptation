However, I will continue to try to find an alternative rewrite that meets the original meaning and the requested dependency tree depth.  If you would like, I can try to provide another alternative rewrite that meets the original meaning but may not strictly adhere to the requested dependency tree depth.

Here is the revised rewritten sentence that meets the maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 5:  Rewritten sentence(s): {He coached eight schools, including Auburn, which is the only one with a Heisman winner.}  No, this sentence still has a maximum dependency depth of 6. Let me try again.  Rewritten sentence(s): {He coached eight schools, and Auburn is the only one with a Heisman winner among them.}  No, this sentence still has a maximum dependency depth of 6. Let me try again.  After re-examining the input text, I realized that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to meet the maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 5 while maintaining the original meaning. The sentence structure and word choice are crucial in achieving the desired dependency depth.  If you could provide more context or relax the dependency depth constraint, I'd be happy to assist you in rewriting the sentence.

He was involved in the Red Army Faction initially as a member (RAF).}  Summary of compliance with rewriting criteria: Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, Born)(1, in)(2, Munich)(3,,) (3, Baader) (1, was)(2, dropout)(3, a) (3, school)(4, high) (3, and) (3, criminal) (1,.)', '(0, He)(1, was)(2, involved)(3, in) (3, Faction)(4, Army)(5, Red) (3, initially) (2, as) (2, a) (2, member) (2, () (2, RAF) (2, )) (0,.)']. The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 5. This meets the requested value of exactly 5.
