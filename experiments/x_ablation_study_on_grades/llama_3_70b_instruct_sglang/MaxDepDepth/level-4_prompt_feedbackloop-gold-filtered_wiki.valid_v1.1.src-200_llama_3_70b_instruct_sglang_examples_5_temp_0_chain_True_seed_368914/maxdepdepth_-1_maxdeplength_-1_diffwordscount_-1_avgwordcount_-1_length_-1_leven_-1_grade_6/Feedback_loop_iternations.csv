To meet the requirement, I can rephrase the sentence slightly:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Practitioners of computer architecture use finer distinctions at Intel, AMD, and others.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, use)(1, Practitioners)(2, of)(3, architecture)(4, computer) (1, distinctions)(2, finer) (1, at)(2, Intel)(3, AMD)(4, and) (4, others) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence is 4, still not meeting the requirement. After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rephrase the sentence to meet the exact maximum dependency tree depth of 5 while maintaining the original meaning. I will continue to try to rephrase the sentence to meet the requirement.  Please let me know if I should continue to revise the sentence.
