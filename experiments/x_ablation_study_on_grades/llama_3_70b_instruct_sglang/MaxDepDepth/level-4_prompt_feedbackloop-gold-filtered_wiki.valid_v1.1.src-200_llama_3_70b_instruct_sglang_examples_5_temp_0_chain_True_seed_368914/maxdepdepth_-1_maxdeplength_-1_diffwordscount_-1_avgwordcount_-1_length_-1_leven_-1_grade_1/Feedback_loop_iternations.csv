Here is the revised rewritten sentence(s) with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 3:  {The River broadcasts from the building. It is networked. The stations are in New South Wales. The stations are in Victoria. The stations are in Tasmania. The stations are in South Australia.}  Here's the explanation for each rewritten sentence:  1. "The River broadcasts from the building." * This sentence has a dependency depth of 2, as "broadcasts" is the main verb, and "from the building" is a prepositional phrase modifying the verb. 2. "It is networked." * This sentence has a dependency depth of 2, as "is" is the main verb, and "networked" is a predicate nominative. 3. "The stations are in New South Wales." * This sentence has a dependency depth of 3, as "are" is the main verb, "in" is a preposition, and "New South Wales" is a location. 4. "The stations are in Victoria." * This sentence has a dependency depth of 3, as "are" is the main verb, "in" is a preposition, and "Victoria" is a location. 5. "The stations are in Tasmania." * This sentence has a dependency depth of 3, as "are" is the main verb, "in" is a preposition, and "Tasmania" is a location. 6. "The stations are in South Australia." * This sentence has a dependency depth of 3, as "are" is the main verb, "in" is a preposition, and "South Australia" is a location.  By breaking down the original sentence into these six simpler sentences, I have reduced the maximum dependency depth to 3, while maintaining the original meaning of the text.
