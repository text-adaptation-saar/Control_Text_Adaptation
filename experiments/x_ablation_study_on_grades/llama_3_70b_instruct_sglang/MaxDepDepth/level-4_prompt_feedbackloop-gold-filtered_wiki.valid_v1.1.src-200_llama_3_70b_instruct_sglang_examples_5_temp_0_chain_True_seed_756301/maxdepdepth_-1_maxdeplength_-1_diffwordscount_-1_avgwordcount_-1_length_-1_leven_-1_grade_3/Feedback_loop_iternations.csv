line_number, 82, iternation, 5, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I'm having trouble rewriting the sentence to meet the exact maximum dependency tree depth of 5. I will continue to revise the sentence until I meet the requirement.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to exactly 5 levels of dependency without altering the original meaning. However, I can provide a rewritten sentence that reduces the dependency depth while maintaining the original meaning:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Maubec is a commune in Vaucluse. It is in Provence-Alpes region.
