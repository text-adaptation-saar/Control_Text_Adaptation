It also has 26 sporadic ones.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, has)(1, list)(2, The) (1, families) (2, of) (2, groups) (1,.)', '(0, has)(1, It) (1, also) (2, 26) (2, ones) (2, sporadic) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 3.

I apologize for the mistake. I will continue to revise the sentence to meet the requirement of exactly 5.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to exactly 5 levels of dependency without altering the original meaning. However, I can provide a rewritten sentence that reduces the dependency depth while maintaining the original meaning:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Maubec is a commune in Vaucluse of Provence. Maubec is in Alpes region. Maubec is in southeastern France.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, is)(1, Maubec) (1, a) (1, commune) (1, in)(2, Vaucluse) (2, of)(3, Provence) (1,.)', '(0, is)(1, Maubec) (1, in)(2, region) (2, Alpes) (1,.)', '(0, is)(1, Maubec) (1, in)(2, France)(3, southeastern) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence is 3. While it doesn't meet the exact requirement of 5, it reduces the complexity of the original sentence. I will continue to revise the sentence to meet the requirement of exactly 5.

The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 2. This meets the requested value of exactly 2.  Rewritten sentence(s): {The chicken is domesticated.}  Explanation: To reduce the dependency tree depth from 3 to 2, I removed the scientific name "(Gallus gallus domesticus)" and the phrase "a fowl" from the original sentence, as they are not essential to the core meaning of the sentence. The rewritten sentence still conveys the main idea that the chicken is domesticated.

They completed 90% of the distance.}  This rewritten sentence pair meets the maximum dependency depth of 4 and conveys the original meaning in a simpler structure.
