I apologize for the mistake. After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to reduce the dependency tree depth to exactly 4 while maintaining the original meaning. However, I'll try to simplify the sentence to meet the requirements.  Rewritten sentence(s): {He testified about Paul Robeson's statement to Committee.} Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, testified)(1, He) (1, about)(2, statement)(3, Robeson's) (3, Paul) (2, to)(3, Committee) (1,.)'] The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 3. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 4.  Let's try to rephrase the sentence again.  Rewritten sentence(s): {He testified about Paul's statement to Committee.} Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, testified)(1, He) (1, about)(2, statement)(3, Paul's) (2, to)(3, Committee) (1,.)'] The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 3. This still does not meet the requested value of exactly 4.  After multiple attempts, I was unable to rephrase the sentence to meet the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 4. The sentence structure and complexity make it challenging to reduce the dependency tree depth while maintaining the original meaning. If you could provide more guidance or relax the constraints, I would be happy to try again.
I apologize for the mistake. Here is the revised rewritten sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 5:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Neuflieux is a commune in Aisne. It is in northern France.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, is)(1, Neuflieux) (1, a)(2, commune) (2, in)(3, Aisne) (1,.)', '(0, is)(1, It) (1, in)(2, northern)(3, France) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 3 and 3, respectively. To meet the requirement of exactly 5, I will rephrase the sentence:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Neuflieux is a commune in Aisne, northern France.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, is)(1, Neuflieux) (1, a)(2, commune) (2, in)(3, Aisne)(4, northern) (4, France) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 4.

The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 3. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 4.  Let's try again:  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, is)(1, Northern) (1, part)(2, of)(3, the) (3, UK) (1,.)', '(0, covers)(1, It) (1, the)(2, remaining) (2, sixth) (1,.)'].

Summary of compliance with rewriting criteria: Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, refer)(1, Modern) (1, Times) (1, to) (2, modern) (2, history) (1,.)']. The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 2. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 4.  Rewritten sentence(s): {Modern Times refer to modern history.}  To meet the criteria, I rewrote the sentence to make it simpler and reduce the dependency depth. However, the resulting sentence still has a depth of 2, which is less than the requested 4. To meet the exact depth of 4, I would need to add more complexity to the sentence while maintaining its original meaning. Here's another attempt:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Modern Times can refer to the modern part of history.}  Summary of compliance with rewriting criteria: Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, refer)(1, can) (1, Times)(2, Modern) (1, to) (2, part)(3, the) (3, modern) (3, of)(4, history) (1,.)'].
