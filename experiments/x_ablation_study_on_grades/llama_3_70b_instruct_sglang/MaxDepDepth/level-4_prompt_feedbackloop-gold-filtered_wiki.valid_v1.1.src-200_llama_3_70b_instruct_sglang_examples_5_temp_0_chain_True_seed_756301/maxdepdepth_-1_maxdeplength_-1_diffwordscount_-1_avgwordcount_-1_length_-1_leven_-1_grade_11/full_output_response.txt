I apologize for the mistake. After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to exactly meet the maximum dependency tree depth of 4 while maintaining the original meaning. The sentence structure and word choice are limiting the ability to achieve a depth of 4.  However, I will continue to explore alternative rewrites to meet the requirement. Here is a revised sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 4:  Rewritten sentence(s): {The inhabitants were affected by the 2005 earthquake.} Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, affected)(1, inhabitants)(2, The) (1, were) (1, by)(2, the) (2, 2005) (2, earthquake) (1,.)'] The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence is 2, which is still not meeting the requested value of exactly 4.

I will continue to revise the sentence until it meets the requirement. If you have any suggestions or guidance, please let me know.
