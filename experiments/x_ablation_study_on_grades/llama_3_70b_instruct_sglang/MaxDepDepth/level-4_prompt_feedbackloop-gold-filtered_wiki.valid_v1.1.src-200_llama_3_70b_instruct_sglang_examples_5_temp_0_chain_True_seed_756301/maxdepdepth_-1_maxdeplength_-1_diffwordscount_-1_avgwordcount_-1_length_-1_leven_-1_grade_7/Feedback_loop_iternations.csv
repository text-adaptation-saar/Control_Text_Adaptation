line_number, 125, iternation, 9, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to achieve a rewritten sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 5. I will continue to revise the sentence until it meets the requested criteria.  If you would like, I can try to break down the sentence into smaller sentences or rephrase it in a way that achieves a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 5. Please let me know if there are any specific requirements or guidelines I should follow.  Alternatively, I can also try to generate a new rewritten sentence that meets the criteria. Please let me know if you would like me to proceed with that approach.

line_number, 166, iternation, 7, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to find a rewritten sentence that meets the exact maximum dependency tree depth of 5. I will continue to try to find a solution.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to meet the exact maximum dependency tree depth of 5 while maintaining the original meaning. The sentence structure and word choice are limiting the possibilities.  If you could provide more context or relax the constraint on the maximum dependency tree depth, I would be happy to try again. Alternatively, I can try to rewrite the sentence in a different way that may not meet the exact maximum dependency tree depth of 5 but still conveys the same meaning.  Please let me know how I can assist further.
