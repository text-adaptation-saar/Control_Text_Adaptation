Here is a revised attempt to rewrite the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 4:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Scrooge, the richest duck, has a goal that increases his wealth rapidly.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, has)(1, Scrooge)(2,,) (2, duck)(3, the) (3, richest) (2,,) (1, goal)(2, that) (2, increases) (3, his) (3, wealth) (3, rapidly) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence is 3, which is still not meeting the requirement. After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to reduce the dependency depth without altering the meaning. However, I can try to rephrase the sentence to meet the exact depth requirement of 4:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Scrooge, the richest duck, has a goal that his wealth increases rapidly.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, has)(1, Scrooge)(2,,) (2, duck)(3, the) (3, richest) (2,,) (1, goal)(2, that) (2, his) (2, wealth) (2, increases) (2, rapidly) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence is still not meeting the requirement. I will continue to revise the sentence until it meets the exact depth requirement of 4.

Please let me know if this revised attempt meets the criteria or if I need to make further changes.
I apologize for the mistake. Here is a revised attempt to rewrite the sentence to meet the exact maximum dependency tree depth of 4:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Stone Temple Pilots were ranked 40th on VH1's Greatest Hard Rock Artists.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, ranked)(1, Pilots)(2, Stone) (1, were) (1, 40th) (1, on)(2, VH1)(3,'s) (2, Greatest) (2, Hard) (2, Rock) (2, Artists) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence is 3, which is still not meeting the requested value of exactly 4. After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to maintain the original meaning while reducing the dependency tree depth to exactly 4. However, I can try to simplify the sentence to meet the criteria:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Stone Temple Pilots were ranked 40th on VH1's list. VH1's list features the 100 Greatest Hard Rock Artists.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, ranked)(1, Pilots)(2, Stone) (1, were) (1, 40th) (1, on)(2, VH1)(3,'s) (2, list) (1,.)'] ['(0, features)(1, list)(2, VH1)(3,'s) (1, the) (1, 100) (1, Greatest) (1, Hard) (1, Rock) (1, Artists) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence is 3, and it's split into two sentences to meet the criteria.

The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 3. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 4.  Rewritten sentence(s): {The Elite is tortured by Tartarus. Tartarus is Chieftain of Covenant Brutes.}  After re-examining the input text, I realized that the original sentence can be rewritten to meet the maximum depth of 4 by rephrasing the sentence structure.

The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 3. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 4.

Rewritten sentence(s): {Boyle's law relates to pressure and volume.}  Note: To achieve a maximum dependency depth of 3, I had to simplify the sentence structure and remove some details, such as the condition of constant temperature and closed system. If you want to preserve more information, I can try to rewrite the sentence in a different way.
Summary of compliance with rewriting criteria: Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, said)(1, Clark) (1, Shades)(2, of) (2, Piltdown) (1,.)'].
