After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rephrase it to exactly 5 levels of dependency without changing the original meaning or adding unnecessary words. The sentence structure and word choice are limiting the possibilities for rephrasing.

This meets the requested value of exactly 3.
line_number, 196, iternation, 3, response, I apologize for the mistake. Here is a revised sentence that meets the criteria:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Each season is its own nomination.} Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, is)(1, season)(2, Each) (1, own) (1, nomination)(2, its) (1,.)'] The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 2. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 3.  To meet the criteria, I rewrote the sentence again:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Each season has its own nomination.} Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, has)(1, season)(2, Each) (1, own) (1, nomination)(2, its) (1,.)'] The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 2. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 3.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rephrase it to meet the exact depth of 3 while maintaining the original meaning. However, I can try to rephrase it to get closer to the desired depth:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Each season has a its nomination.} Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, has)(1, season)(2, Each) (1, a) (1, nomination)(2, its) (1,.)'] The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 2. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 3.  I will continue to revise the sentence until it meets the criteria:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Each has a season its nomination.} Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, has)(1, Each) (1, a) (1, season) (1, its) (1, nomination) (1,.)'] The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 1. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 3.  After multiple attempts, I was unable to rephrase the sentence to meet the exact depth of 3 while maintaining the original meaning. I apologize for not being able to meet the criteria.

This does not meet the requested value of exactly 3.  After multiple attempts, I was unable to rephrase the sentence to meet the exact depth of 3 while maintaining the original meaning. I apologize for not being able to meet the criteria.  However, I would like to propose an alternative approach. Instead of rephrasing the sentence, I can try to break it down into two sentences, each with a maximum dependency depth of 3:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Each season has its own nomination. It earned a prize.} Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, has)(1, season)(2, Each) (1, own) (1, nomination) (1,.)'] ['(0, earned)(1, It) (1, prize) (1, a) (1,.)'] The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 2 for each sentence. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 3.  Please let me know if this alternative approach is acceptable or if I should continue to revise the sentence to meet the original criteria.
