Later, he incorporated this experience into his musical arrangements, which were highly acclaimed.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, played)(1, He) (1, with)(2, Commanders)(3, Aaronson)(4,'s) (1, in)(2, 1929)(3, and) (3, 1930) (1,,) (1, gained)(2, during)(3, time)(4, which) (2, he) (2, experience) (3, of)(4, music)(5, symphonic) (1,.)', '(0, incorporated)(1, Later) (1, he) (1, this) (1, experience) (1, into)(2, arrangements)(3, musical) (2, which) (2, were) (2, acclaimed) (2, highly) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence is still not meeting the requested value of exactly 5. I will continue to revise the sentence until it meets the criteria.  If you could provide more guidance or clarification on how to achieve the desired dependency tree depth, I would appreciate it.
