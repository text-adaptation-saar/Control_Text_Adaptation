Here is the revised rewritten sentence(s) with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 3:  {The London County Council Tramways passed to the Board. The Board is London Transport. The date was 1 July 1933.}  Here's the explanation:  1. I broke down the original sentence into three simpler sentences to reduce the dependency tree depth. 2. In the first sentence, I rephrased the original sentence to focus on the main action "passed" and its related entities, keeping the dependency tree depth at 3. 3. In the second sentence, I rephrased the original sentence to focus on the definition of the Board, keeping the dependency tree depth at 3. 4. In the third sentence, I rephrased the original sentence to focus on the date, keeping the dependency tree depth at 3.  The rewritten sentences meet the criteria of maintaining the original meaning while adhering to a maximum depth of the dependency tree of exactly 3.

Here is a revised attempt to rewrite the input text to maintain its original meaning while strictly adhering to a maximum depth of the dependency tree of exactly 3:  Rewritten sentence(s): {105.7 The River broadcasts from a building. It is networked. The stations are in New South Wales. The stations are in Victoria. The stations are in Tasmania. The stations are in South Australia.}  Here's the explanation for each rewritten sentence:  1. "105.7 The River broadcasts from a building." * This sentence has a dependency depth of 3: `(0, broadcasts)(1, 105.7)(2, from)`. * It conveys the main idea of the original sentence, which is that 105.7 The River broadcasts from a specific building. 2. "It is networked." * This sentence has a dependency depth of 2: `(0, is)(1, networked)`. * It conveys the additional information that 105.7 The River is networked. 3. "The stations are in New South Wales." * This sentence has a dependency depth of 3: `(0, are)(1, stations)(2, in)`. * It lists one of the locations where the local stations are located. 4. "The stations are in Victoria." * This sentence has a dependency depth of 3: `(0, are)(1, stations)(2, in)`. * It lists another location where the local stations are located. 5.
