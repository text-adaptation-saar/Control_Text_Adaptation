However, I must admit that it's challenging to maintain the original meaning while increasing the dependency tree depth to exactly 7. The sentence structure and wording need to be significantly altered to achieve this.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's difficult to create a sentence with a dependency tree depth of exactly 7 while maintaining the original meaning.
