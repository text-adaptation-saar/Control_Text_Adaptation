I will continue to revise the sentence until it meets the criteria.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rephrase the original sentence to exactly meet the maximum dependency tree depth of 6 while maintaining its original meaning. However, I can try to rephrase the sentence to get closer to the requested depth.
