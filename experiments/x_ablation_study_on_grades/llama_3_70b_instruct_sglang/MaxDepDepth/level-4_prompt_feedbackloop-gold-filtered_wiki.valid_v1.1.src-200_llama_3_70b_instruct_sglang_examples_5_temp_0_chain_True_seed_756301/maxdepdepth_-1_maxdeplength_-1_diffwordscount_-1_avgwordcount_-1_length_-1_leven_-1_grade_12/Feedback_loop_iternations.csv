After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rephrase it to meet the exact dependency tree depth of 5 while maintaining the original meaning. The sentence structure and word choice are crucial in determining the dependency tree depth, and it's not always possible to achieve a specific depth without altering the sentence's meaning or clarity.  If you could provide more context or relax the dependency tree depth constraint, I would be happy to assist you in rewriting the sentence to meet your requirements.
