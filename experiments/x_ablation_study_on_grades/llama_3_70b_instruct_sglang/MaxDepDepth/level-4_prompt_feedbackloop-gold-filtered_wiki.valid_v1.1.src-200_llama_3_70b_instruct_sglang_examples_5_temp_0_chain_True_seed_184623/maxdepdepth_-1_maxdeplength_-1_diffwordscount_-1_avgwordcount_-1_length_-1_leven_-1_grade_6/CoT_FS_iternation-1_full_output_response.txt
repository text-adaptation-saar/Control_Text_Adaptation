Rewritten sentence(s): {Dominant champion Holmes successfully defended the WBC belt until 1983, then gave up the title for the IBF title.}  After re-examining the input text, I realized that it's challenging to maintain the original meaning while adhering to a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 5. However, I can try to simplify the sentence structure to reduce the dependency tree depth. Here's another attempt:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Dominant champion Holmes defended the WBC belt 17 times. He relinquished the title in 1983 to become the IBF champion.}  In this rewritten version, I broke the original sentence into two simpler sentences, each with a lower dependency tree depth. The first sentence describes Holmes' defense of the WBC belt, and the second sentence explains his decision to relinquish the title and become the IBF champion.

The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 4. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 5.  Let's try to rephrase the sentence to meet the criteria:  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, has)(1, Cabin)(2, Tom)(3, Uncle) (3,'s) (1, had)(2, a)(3, significant) (3, influence) (2, on)(3, history) (1,.)'].

The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 4. This meets the requested value of exactly 4.  Rewritten sentence(s): {In physiology, a signal is an electric quantity caused by reactions.}  To achieve this, I simplified the sentence by removing unnecessary words and phrases, and rephrased the sentence to reduce the dependency depth. I removed the phrase "or biopotential" as it's not essential to the main meaning of the sentence. I also removed the list of electric quantities (voltage, current, or field strength) and replaced it with a more general term "electric quantity". Finally, I rephrased the sentence to make it more concise and reduce the dependency depth.

The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 4. This is close to the requested value of exactly 5. To meet the criteria, I will rephrase the sentence to increase the depth to 5.  Rewritten sentence(s): {George Smoot was responsible for measuring the small temperature variations in the radiation.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, was)(1, responsible)(2, Smoot)(3, George) (2, for)(3, measuring)(4, variations)(5, small) (4, temperature) (4, in)(5, radiation) (1,.)'].

The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 4. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 5.  After re-examining the input text, I realized that it's challenging to maintain the original meaning while adhering to a maximum depth of 5. However, I can provide a rewritten sentence that meets the criteria:  Rewritten sentence(s): {About 2-3 million years ago, the Isthmus of Panama formed, connecting South America to North America. This allowed a biotic exchange between the two continents.}  In this rewritten sentence, I broke the original sentence into two simpler sentences, each with a maximum dependency depth of 4.

Rewritten sentence(s): {Maubec is a commune in Vaucluse department in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur in southeastern France.}  After re-examining the input text, I realized that it's challenging to reduce the dependency tree depth to exactly 6 while maintaining the original meaning. The original sentence is already quite concise, and breaking it down further would likely alter the meaning or make the sentence less clear.  However, I can suggest a rewritten sentence that simplifies the structure while maintaining the original meaning:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Maubec is a commune in the Vaucluse department, located in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region of southeastern France.}  This rewritten sentence has a Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree of: ['(0, is)(1, Maubec) (1, commune)(2, in)(3, department) (3, the) (3, Vaucluse) (1,,) (1, located)(2, in)(3, region) (3, the) (3, Provence) (3, -) (3, Alpes) (3, -) (3, Côte) (3, d'Azur) (2, of)(3, France)(4, southeastern) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for this rewritten sentence is 4, which is still not exactly 6. However, it's a more simplified structure that maintains the original meaning.

The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 4. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 5.  After re-examining the input text, I realized that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to maintain the original meaning while adhering to a maximum depth of 5. The original sentence has a complex structure with multiple clauses and phrases, making it difficult to simplify while preserving the same level of detail.  However, I can provide a rewritten sentence that comes close to meeting the criteria:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Arad is a county of Romania, in Crișana and Banat, with its capital city at Arad. The city has a population of 185,272.}  This rewritten sentence has a maximum dependency depth of 4, which is close to the requested value of 5. I apologize for not being able to exactly meet the criteria, but I hope this rewritten sentence is still helpful.

The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 3. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 4.  Let's try to rephrase the sentence to increase the dependency depth to 4:  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, is)(1, Namli) (1, Maira) (1, area)(2, a) (2, mountainous) (2, rural) (2, located)(3, in)(4, Abbottabad) (1,.)'].

Rewritten sentence(s): {In July, he was called to testify to HUAC about statements made by Paul Robeson.}
To increase the dependency tree depth to 6, I will rephrase the sentence to introduce an additional level of nesting. Here's the rewritten sentence:  {The commune of Neuflieux is located in the department of Aisne, which is situated in the region of Picardy, in the northern part of France.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, is)(1, The) (1, commune) (1, of)(2, Neuflieux) (1, located) (1, in)(2, department) (2, of)(3, Aisne) (1, which) (1, is) (1, situated) (1, in)(2, region) (2, of)(3, Picardy) (1, in)(2, part) (2, northern) (2, of)(3, France) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence is 3, which is still not meeting the requirement.
