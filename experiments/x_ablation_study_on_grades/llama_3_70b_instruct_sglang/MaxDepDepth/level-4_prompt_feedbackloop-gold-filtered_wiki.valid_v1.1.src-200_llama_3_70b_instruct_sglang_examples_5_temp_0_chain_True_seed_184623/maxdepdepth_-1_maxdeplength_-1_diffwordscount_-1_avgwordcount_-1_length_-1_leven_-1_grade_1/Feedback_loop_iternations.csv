"105.7 The River broadcasts from a building." * This sentence has a dependency depth of 3: `(0, broadcasts)(1, 105.7)(2, from)`. * It conveys the main idea of the original sentence, which is that 105.7 The River broadcasts from a specific building. 2. "It is networked." * This sentence has a dependency depth of 2: `(0, is)(1, networked)`. * It conveys the additional information that 105.7 The River is networked. 3. "The stations are in New South Wales." * This sentence has a dependency depth of 3: `(0, are)(1, stations)(2, in)`. * It lists the location of the stations, which was part of the original sentence. 4. "The stations are in Victoria." * This sentence has a dependency depth of 3: `(0, are)(1, stations)(2, in)`. * It lists another location of the stations. 5. "The stations are in Tasmania." * This sentence has a dependency depth of 3: `(0, are)(1, stations)(2, in)`. * It lists another location of the stations. 6. "The stations are in South Australia." * This sentence has a dependency depth of 3: `(0, are)(1, stations)(2, in)`. * It lists another location of the stations.  By breaking down the original sentence into six simpler sentences, I was able to reduce the dependency depth to exactly 3 while maintaining the original meaning.

line_number, 102, iternation, 1, response, I apologize for the mistake. Here is the revised rewritten sentence(s) with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 3:  {The school's HLMA team got an Honourable Mention. The team includes Ma Chit. The team includes Lam Ho Man. The team includes Kwok Wing Hei. The team includes Wan Kai Chung. The team includes Yip Shun.}  Here's the explanation for the rewritten sentences:  1. The first sentence "The school's HLMA team got an Honourable Mention." has a dependency depth of 3: `(0, got)(1, team)(2, school's)`. 2. The subsequent sentences "The team includes [Student's Name]." have a dependency depth of 3: `(0, includes)(1, team)(2, Ma)`, `(0, includes)(1, team)(2, Lam)`, and so on for each student's name.  By breaking down the original text into simpler sentences, I was able to reduce the dependency depth to exactly 3 while maintaining the original meaning.

line_number, 114, iternation, 7, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I'm having trouble rewriting the sentence to exactly meet the maximum dependency tree depth of 3 while maintaining the original meaning. I will continue to revise the sentence until it meets the criteria.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to exactly meet the maximum dependency tree depth of 3 while maintaining the original meaning. However, I can try to get closer to the target.  Here is another revised attempt: Rewritten sentence(s): {Heavyweights is a 1995 Disney comedy film. It was directed by Brill. It was co-written by Brill and Apatow.} Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, is)(1, Heavyweights) (1, film)(2, a) (2, 1995) (2, Disney) (2, comedy) (1,.)', '(0, directed)(1, It) (1, was) (1, by)(2, Brill) (1,.)', '(0, co-written)(1, It) (1, was) (1, by)(2, Brill) (1, and)(2, Apatow) (1,.)'] The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is still not exactly 3. I will continue to revise the sentence until it meets the criteria.  If you would like, I can try to break down the sentence into simpler sentences or rephrase it to better meet the criteria. Please let me know how I can assist further.

It airs feedback.}  Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, is)(1, FNMTV) (1, program) (1,.)', '(0, airs)(1, It) (1, feedback) (1,.)']  The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence(s), as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 2. This meets the requested value of exactly 2.
