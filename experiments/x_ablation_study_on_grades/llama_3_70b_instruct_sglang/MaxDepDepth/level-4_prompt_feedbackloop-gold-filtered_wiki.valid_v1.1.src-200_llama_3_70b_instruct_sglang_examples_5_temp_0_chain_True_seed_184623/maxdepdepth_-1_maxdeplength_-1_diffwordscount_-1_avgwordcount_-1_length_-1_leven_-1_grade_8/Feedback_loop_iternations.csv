line_number, 2, iternation, 1, response, I apologize for the mistake. Here is a revised rewritten sentence that meets the maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 9:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Quercamps is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department, which is in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region in France.}  Here's the explanation:  1.
