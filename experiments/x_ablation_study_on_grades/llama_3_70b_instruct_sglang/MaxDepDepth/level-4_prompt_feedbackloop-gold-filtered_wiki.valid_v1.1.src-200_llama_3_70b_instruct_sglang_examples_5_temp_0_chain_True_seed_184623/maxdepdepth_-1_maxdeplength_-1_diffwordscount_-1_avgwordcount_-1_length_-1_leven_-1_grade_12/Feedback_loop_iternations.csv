To meet the requirement of a maximum dependency depth of 4, I can rephrase the sentence to introduce a slight complexity while maintaining the original meaning.

If you would like, I can provide additional attempts or seek guidance on how to better approach this challenge.  However, I would like to propose an alternative approach. Instead of rephrasing the sentence, I can try to break it down into two simpler sentences, each with a maximum dependency depth of 4 or less.
