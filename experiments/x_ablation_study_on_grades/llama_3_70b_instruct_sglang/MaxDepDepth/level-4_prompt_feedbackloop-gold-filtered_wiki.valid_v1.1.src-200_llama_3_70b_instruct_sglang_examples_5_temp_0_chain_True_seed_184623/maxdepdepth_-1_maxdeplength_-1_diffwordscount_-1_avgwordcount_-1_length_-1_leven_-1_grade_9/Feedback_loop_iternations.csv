"Mercury has a freezing point." - This sentence has a dependency depth of 2. 2. "It is â '38.83 Â C." - This sentence has a dependency depth of 3. 3. "Mercury has a boiling point." - This sentence has a dependency depth of 2. 4. "It is 356.73 Â C." - This sentence has a dependency depth of 3. 5. "Mercury has a broad liquid range." - This sentence has a dependency depth of 3. 6. "It is a metal." - This sentence has a dependency depth of 2.  By breaking down the original sentence into these six simpler sentences, I was able to reduce the maximum dependency depth to 4, meeting the required criteria.
