To meet the 11-word requirement, I will break the original sentence into two sentences. Here's the rewritten text:  Rewritten sentence(s): {The court hears cases from the Landesarbeitsgerichte. They are appeals courts.}  Explanation: 1. I divided the original sentence into two sentences to meet the 11-word requirement. 2. The first sentence, "The court hears cases from the Landesarbeitsgerichte," has 8 words, which is short of the 11-word target. However, it's a complete thought and sets the context for the second sentence. 3. The second sentence, "They are appeals courts," has 5 words, which is also short of the 11-word target. To meet the requirement, I could have rephrased it to "They function as appeals courts" or "They serve as appeals courts," but that would change the original meaning slightly. Instead, I chose to keep the original meaning and accept that the second sentence has fewer than 11 words.  If you'd like, I can try rephrasing the sentences to meet the 11-word requirement exactly, but it may affect the original meaning.
