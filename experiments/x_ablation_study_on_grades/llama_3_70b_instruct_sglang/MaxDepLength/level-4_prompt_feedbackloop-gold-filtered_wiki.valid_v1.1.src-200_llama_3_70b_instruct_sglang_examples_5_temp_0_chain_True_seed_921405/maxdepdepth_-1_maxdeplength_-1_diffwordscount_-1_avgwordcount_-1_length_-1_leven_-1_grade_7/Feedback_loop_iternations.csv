However, I would like to clarify that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to meet the maximum dependency length of exactly 8 while maintaining the original meaning and grammatical correctness. The sentence structure and word choice play a significant role in determining the dependency length, and it's not always possible to achieve a specific dependency length without compromising the sentence's clarity and coherence.  If you could provide more guidance or flexibility on the rewriting criteria, I would be happy to try again. Alternatively, I can suggest alternative sentences that meet the maximum dependency length of exactly 8, but may not exactly convey the same meaning as the original sentence.  Please let me know how I can proceed.
