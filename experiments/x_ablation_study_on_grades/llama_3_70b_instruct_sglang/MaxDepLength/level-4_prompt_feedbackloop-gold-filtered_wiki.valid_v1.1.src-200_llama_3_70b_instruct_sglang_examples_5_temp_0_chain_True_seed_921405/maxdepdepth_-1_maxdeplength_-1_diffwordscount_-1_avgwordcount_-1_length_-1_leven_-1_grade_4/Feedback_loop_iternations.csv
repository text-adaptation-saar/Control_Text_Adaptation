line_number, 82, iternation, 10, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I made an error in my previous responses. After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to meet the exact maximum dependency length of 7 while maintaining the original meaning.  However, I'll continue to try and find a solution. If you could provide more context or flexibility in the rewriting criteria, I may be able to find a better solution.  Alternatively, I can try to rewrite the sentence to make it as close to the maximum dependency length of 7 as possible. Here's another attempt:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Maubec is a commune in Vaucluse department. It is situated in the Provence-Alpes region of France, which is in southeastern.}  Rewritten sentence's Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ["(0, 'is') [(1, 'Maubec') (2, 'commune') [(1, 'a') (1, 'in') [(2, 'department') [(1, 'Vaucluse')]]]]", "(0,'situated') [(2, 'It') (1, 'is') (1, 'in') [(4,'region') [(3, 'the') (1, 'Provence-Alpes')] (5, 'of') [(2, 'France')] (6, 'which') [(1, 'is') (1, 'in') [(2,'southeastern')]]]]"]  The rewritten sentence's maximum dependency length is 6, which is still short of the target length of 7. I apologize for not meeting the exact criteria. If you have any further guidance or flexibility, I'll be happy to try again.
