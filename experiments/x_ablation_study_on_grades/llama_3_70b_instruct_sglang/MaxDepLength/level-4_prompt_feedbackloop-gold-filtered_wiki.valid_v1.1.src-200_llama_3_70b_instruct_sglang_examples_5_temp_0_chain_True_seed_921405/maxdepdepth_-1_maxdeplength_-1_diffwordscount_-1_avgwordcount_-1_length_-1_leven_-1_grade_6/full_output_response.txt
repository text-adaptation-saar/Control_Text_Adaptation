I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to achieve a maximum dependency length of exactly 5 with the previous rewrites. I will continue to revise the sentence until the criteria are met.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to achieve a maximum dependency length of exactly 5 while maintaining the original meaning and grammatical correctness. The sentence structure and word choice are limiting the ability to increase the dependency length.  I would like to request clarification or additional guidance on how to proceed. Would it be acceptable to rephrase the sentence to achieve a maximum dependency length of exactly 5, even if it means changing the original meaning or sentence structure? Or are there any specific requirements or constraints that I should be aware of?  Please let me know how to proceed, and I will do my best to meet the requirements.
