This does not meet the requested value of exactly 5. After re-examining the input text, I realized that the original sentence can be rewritten to meet the maximum dependency length of 5 by rephrasing the sentence structure. Here is the revised rewritten sentence:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Jackie is in New South Wales at Braidwood.}  Rewritten sentence's Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ["(0, 'is') [(1, 'Jackie') (1, 'in') [(2, 'New') (1, 'South') (1, 'Wales')] (4, 'at') [(1, 'Braidwood')]]"  The maximum dependency length for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" is 5.
