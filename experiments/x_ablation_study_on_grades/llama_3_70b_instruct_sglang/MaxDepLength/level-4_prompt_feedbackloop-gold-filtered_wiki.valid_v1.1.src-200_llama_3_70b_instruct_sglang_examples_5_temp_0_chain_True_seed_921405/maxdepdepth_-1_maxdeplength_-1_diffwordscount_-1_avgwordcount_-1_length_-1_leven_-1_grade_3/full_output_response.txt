To rewrite the input text and maintain its original meaning while adhering to a maximum dependency length of exactly 4, I will break down the sentence into smaller clauses and rephrase them to reduce the dependency length.  Original sentence: "Broadcast out of the same building is 105.7 The River, which is also networked to local stations around New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia."  Rewritten sentence(s): {The broadcast is from the same building. It is 105.7 The River. This station is networked to local stations in New South Wales. It is also networked to stations in Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia.}  Here's the explanation for the rewritten sentences:  1. "The broadcast is from the same building." - This sentence has a dependency length of 4, as it only connects the subject "broadcast" with the prepositional phrase "from the same building". 2. "It is 105.7 The River." - This sentence has a dependency length of 3, as it only connects the subject "it" with the predicate "105.7 The River". 3. "This station is networked to local stations in New South Wales." - This sentence has a dependency length of 4, as it connects the subject "station" with the verb "is networked" and the prepositional phrase "to local stations in New South Wales". 4. "It is also networked to stations in Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia." - This sentence has a dependency length of 4, as it connects the subject "it" with the verb "is networked" and the prepositional phrase "to stations in Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia".  By breaking down the original sentence into smaller clauses, I was able to reduce the dependency length to 4 or less for each sentence, while maintaining the original meaning of the text.
