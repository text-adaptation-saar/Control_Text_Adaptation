I apologize for the mistake. Here is a revised version of the sentence with a maximum dependency length of exactly 10:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Some practitioners of computer architecture at companies like Intel and AMD use finer distinctions.}  Rewritten sentence's Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ["(0, 'use') [(9, 'practitioners') [(1, 'Some') (1, 'of') [(2, 'architecture') [(1, 'computer')]] (3, 'at') [(1, 'companies') [(2, 'like') [(1, 'Intel') (1, 'and') (2, 'AMD')]]]]] (2, 'finer') (1, 'distinctions')]].
