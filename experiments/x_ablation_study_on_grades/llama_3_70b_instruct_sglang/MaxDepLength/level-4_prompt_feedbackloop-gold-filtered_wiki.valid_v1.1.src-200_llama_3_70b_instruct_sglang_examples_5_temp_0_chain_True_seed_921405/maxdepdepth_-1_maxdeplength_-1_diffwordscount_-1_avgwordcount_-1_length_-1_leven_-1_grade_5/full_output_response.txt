To meet the criteria, I will rephrase the sentence to increase the dependency length while maintaining the original meaning:  Rewritten sentence's Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ["(0, 'was') [(1, 'It') (2, 'ancient') (3, 'capital') [(1, 'of') [(1, 'Cerdanya')] (4, 'during') [(1, 'antiquity')]]]", "(0,'replaced') [(1, 'It') (2, 'was') (3, 'later') (4, 'by') [(1, 'Hix')] (5, 'in') [(1, 'Middle') (1, 'Ages')]]", "(0, 'is') [(1, 'Hix') (2, 'now') (3, 'part') [(1, 'of') [(1, 'Bourg-Madame')] (4, 'located') [(1, 'in') [(1, 'France')]]]]"].

If you could provide more guidance or flexibility on the rewriting criteria, I would be happy to try again. Alternatively, I can suggest alternative sentences that meet the maximum dependency length of exactly 6, but may not convey the same meaning as the original sentence.
