line_number, 61, iternation, 10, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to meet the maximum dependency length of exactly 6 in my previous attempts. I will make sure to revise the sentence again to meet the requirements.  However, I would like to clarify that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to meet the maximum dependency length of exactly 6 while maintaining the original meaning and grammatical correctness. The sentence structure and word choice play a significant role in determining the dependency length, and it's not always possible to achieve a specific dependency length without compromising the sentence's clarity and coherence.  If you could provide more guidance or flexibility on the rewriting criteria, I would be happy to try again. Alternatively, I can suggest alternative sentences that meet the maximum dependency length of exactly 6, but may not convey the same meaning as the original sentence.
