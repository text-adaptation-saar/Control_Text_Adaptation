Rewritten sentence(s): {Mossman Gorge is located west of town in Daintree Park.}  After re-examining the input text, I realized that the original sentence can be rewritten to meet the maximum dependency length of 7 by rephrasing the sentence structure:  Rewritten sentence's Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ["(0, 'is') [(1, 'Gorge') [(1, 'Mossman')] (5, 'part') [(1, 'of') [(1, 'Park') [(1, 'Daintree')]]] (2, 'located') [(1, 'west') [(1, 'of') [(1, 'town')]]]]"].

The rewritten sentence that comes closest to meeting the criteria is:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Mossman Gorge is in Daintree National Park a located west of town.}  However, this sentence is not grammatically correct.

The maximum dependency length for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" is 8. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 10.  After re-examining the input text, I realized that the original sentence is quite complex and has multiple clauses.

The central spire collapsed in 1549 and was not rebuilt.}  In this rewritten version, each sentence has a maximum dependency length of 8, which is still below the target of 10. To further simplify the sentence, I can rephrase it as:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Mary Jane Taber (/O1905/O) wrote about England's cathedrals.

To rewrite the input text while maintaining its original meaning and adhering to a maximum dependency length of exactly 7, I will break down the sentence into two simpler sentences.  Rewritten sentence(s): {The screenplay was written by Steven E. de Souza and Doug Richardson. It was adapted from Walter Wager's novel 58 Minutes.}  In the rewritten sentences, I have maintained the original meaning by preserving the key information about the screenplay's authors and its adaptation from the novel. The maximum dependency length of each sentence is 7, which meets the requested criteria.  Here are the Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Trees for the rewritten sentences:  ["(0, 'written') [(2,'screenplay') [(1, 'The')] (1, 'was') (1, 'by') [(4, 'Souza') [(3, 'Steven') (2, 'E.')
