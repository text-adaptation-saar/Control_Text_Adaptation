She was a Princess in Cosimo's contract.}  Rewritten sentence's Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ["(0,'surrendered') [(1, 'Marguerite') (2, 'daughter') [(1, 'Gaston') [(1, ''s')]]] (4, 'her') (1, 'rights')", "(0, 'was') [(1, 'She') (2, 'a') (3, 'Princess') (4, 'in') [(2, 'Cosimo') [(1, ''s') (1, 'contract')]]]"]  The maximum dependency length for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree", is 4 and 4 respectively. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 5. I will continue to revise the sentence until the criteria are satisfactorily met.
