I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to achieve a maximum dependency length of exactly 5 with the previous rewrites. I will continue to revise the sentence until the criteria are met.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to achieve a maximum dependency length of exactly 5 while maintaining the original meaning and structure of the sentence. However, I will continue to try and find a solution.  If you would like, I can provide alternative rewrites that may not meet the exact maximum dependency length of 5 but still convey the same meaning and are grammatically correct. Please let me know how I can assist further.  Alternatively, I can try to break down the sentence into smaller parts and rephrase each part to achieve a maximum dependency length of exactly 5. This may result in a longer output, but it would meet the specified criteria.  Please let me know how I can proceed.
