line_number, 106, iternation, 10, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to meet the maximum dependency length of exactly 8 in my previous attempts. I will continue to revise the sentence until I meet the requirements.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to meet the exact maximum dependency length of 8 while maintaining the original meaning and grammatical correctness. However, I will continue to try and find a solution.  If you would like, I can provide an explanation of the challenges I'm facing in meeting the maximum dependency length of 8, and we can discuss possible alternatives or modifications to the original sentence that could help achieve the desired dependency length.  Alternatively, I can try to provide a revised sentence that meets the maximum dependency length of 8, even if it means rephrasing the original sentence significantly. Please let me know which approach you prefer.
