line_number, 39, iternation, 10, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I'm still having trouble creating a sentence with a maximum dependency length of exactly 4. I'll keep trying until I get it right.  Could you please provide more guidance or examples of sentences with a maximum dependency length of 4? This will help me better understand the requirements and create a rewritten sentence that meets the criteria.  Alternatively, if you'd like, I can try to break down the original sentence into smaller parts and rephrase each part to create a sentence with a maximum dependency length of 4. Please let me know if this is an acceptable approach.  I'll continue to revise and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. Thank you for your patience and feedback.

After further re-examination, I realized that it's challenging to reduce the dependency length to exactly 14 while maintaining the original meaning. The original sentence is already quite concise, and rephrasing it to meet the exact dependency length of 14 would require significant changes to the sentence structure, which might alter the original meaning.  If you would like, I can try to provide alternative rewrites that prioritize clarity and concision over meeting the exact dependency length of 14.

line_number, 113, iternation, 10, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to create a rewritten sentence with a maximum dependency length of exactly 7. I will make sure to revise the sentence again to meet the specific requirements.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to create a rewritten sentence with a maximum dependency length of exactly 7 while maintaining the original meaning and structure of the sentence. The sentence has a complex structure with multiple clauses and phrases, making it difficult to reduce the dependency length to 7.  If you could provide more guidance or flexibility on the rewriting criteria, I would be happy to try again. Alternatively, I can suggest a rewritten sentence with a simpler structure that meets the maximum dependency length of 7, but it may not convey the same meaning as the original sentence.  Please let me know how I can assist you further.
