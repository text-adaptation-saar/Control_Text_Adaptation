Unfortunately, it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to meet this specific requirement while maintaining its original meaning.

line_number, 186, iternation, 10, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to rewrite the sentence with a maximum dependency length of exactly 3 while maintaining the original meaning. I will make sure to be more careful in the future. If you would like, I can try to rewrite the sentence again or assist you with a different task. However, I would like to note that it's possible that the original sentence cannot be rewritten to meet the maximum dependency length of exactly 3 while maintaining its original meaning. If that's the case, I would like to discuss alternative solutions with you.

This does not meet the requested value of exactly 3.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to meet the exact maximum dependency length of 3 while maintaining the original meaning. The sentence structure and word choice are limiting the ability to achieve this specific dependency length.  If you would like, I can try to provide an alternative approach or suggest a different rewriting strategy to meet the requirements. Please let me know how I can assist further.
