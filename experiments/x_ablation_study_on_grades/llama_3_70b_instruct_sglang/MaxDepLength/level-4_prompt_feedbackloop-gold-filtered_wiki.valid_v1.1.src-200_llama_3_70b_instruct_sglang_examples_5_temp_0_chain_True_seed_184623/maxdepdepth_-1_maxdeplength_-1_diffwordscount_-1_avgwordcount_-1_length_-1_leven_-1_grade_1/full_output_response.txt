To rewrite the input text and maintain its original meaning while adhering to a maximum dependency length of exactly 4, I will break down the sentence into simpler sentences and rephrase them to meet the criteria.  Original sentence: "Like the cakes, coconut flavor is not always a must in the frosting."  Rewritten sentence(s): {Coconut flavor is not always a must. It is like the cakes in the frosting.}  Here's the explanation:  1. I identified the main clause "coconut flavor is not always a must" which has a dependency length of 4. 2. I extracted the dependent clause "like the cakes" and rephrased it as a separate sentence "It is like the cakes in the frosting" which also has a dependency length of 4. 3. The rewritten sentences maintain the original meaning and meet the criteria of a maximum dependency length of exactly 4.  Note: The rewritten sentences may not be as concise as the original sentence, but they meet the specified requirements while preserving the original meaning.

The reward will be distributed after.}  In this rewritten version, each sentence has a maximum dependency length of 3 or less, and together they convey the original meaning of the input text.
I apologize for the mistake.

I removed the prepositional phrases and focused on the main entities, ensuring that the original meaning is preserved. 3. The rewritten sentences meet the requirement of having a maximum dependency length of exactly 2.  Please let me know if this revised attempt meets the criteria.
