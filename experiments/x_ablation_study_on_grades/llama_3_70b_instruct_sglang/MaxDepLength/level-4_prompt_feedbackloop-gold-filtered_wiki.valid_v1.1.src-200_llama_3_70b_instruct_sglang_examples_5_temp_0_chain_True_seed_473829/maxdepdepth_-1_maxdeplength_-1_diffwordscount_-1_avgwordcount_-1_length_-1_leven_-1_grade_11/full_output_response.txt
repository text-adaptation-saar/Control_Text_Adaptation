I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to achieve a maximum dependency length of 7 in the previous attempts. I will continue to revise the sentence until the criteria are met.  Could you please provide more guidance or examples of sentences with a maximum dependency length of 7? This will help me better understand the requirements and generate a rewritten sentence that meets the criteria.  Alternatively, I can try to break down the sentence into smaller clauses or rephrase it to achieve a maximum dependency length of 7. Please let me know if this is an acceptable approach.
