However, I would like to clarify that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to meet the exact maximum dependency length of 13 while maintaining the original meaning and structure of the sentence. The sentence may need to be rephrased or restructured to achieve this goal.  If you would like, I can try to revise the sentence again to meet the exact maximum dependency length of 13. Alternatively, I can provide a revised sentence that is close to the original sentence but with a maximum dependency length of 13. Please let me know your preference.

I will continue to revise the sentence until the criteria are met.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to achieve a maximum dependency length of exactly 6 while maintaining the original meaning and structure of the sentence. The sentence has a complex structure with multiple clauses and phrases, which makes it difficult to reduce the dependency length to 6.  However, I will continue to try and find a solution. If you would like, I can attempt to simplify the sentence or break it down into multiple sentences to achieve a maximum dependency length of exactly 6.
