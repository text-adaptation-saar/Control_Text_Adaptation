input_src: There are some differences between Jak 3 and Jak II.	output: I apologize for the mistake. I will continue to try until I meet the criteria. However, I must admit that I'm having trouble creating a sentence with a maximum dependency length of exactly 3. It's possible that it's not possible to create a sentence with this specific constraint.  Could you please provide more guidance or examples of sentences with a maximum dependency length of exactly 3? This will help me better understand the requirements and create a rewritten sentence that meets the criteria.  Alternatively, I can try to break down the sentence into smaller parts and rephrase it to meet the maximum dependency length of exactly 3. However, I'm not sure if this approach is acceptable.  Please let me know how I can proceed. I'm willing to continue trying until I meet the criteria.	number_of_examples_found: 5	prompt: [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert in text adaptation, skilled at meticulously rewriting texts to align with requested linguistic features while preserving the original meaning.

This does not meet the requested value of exactly 4. I will continue to revise the sentence until it meets the criteria.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rephrase the original sentence to meet the exact maximum dependency length of 4 while maintaining its original meaning. The sentence structure and word choice are crucial in determining the dependency length. I will continue to work on finding a revised sentence that meets the criteria.  If you would like, I can provide alternative rewritten sentences that approximate the maximum dependency length of 4, but may not exactly meet it.
