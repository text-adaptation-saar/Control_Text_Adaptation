To rewrite the input text and maintain its original meaning while adhering to a maximum dependency length of exactly 6, I will break down the sentence into two simpler sentences.  Rewritten sentence(s): {The screenplay was written by Steven E. de Souza and Doug Richardson. It was adapted from Walter Wager's novel 58 Minutes.}  Here's the explanation:  1. The original sentence is complex and has a maximum dependency length of 10, which exceeds the target length of 6. 2.

The second sentence focuses on the adaptation of the novel, and its Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree has a maximum dependency length of 5. 5. Both sentences are within the target maximum dependency length of 6, and they maintain the original meaning of the input text.

This distinguishes it from the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria.}  In this rewritten version, each sentence has a maximum dependency length of 4, and the original meaning is preserved.
