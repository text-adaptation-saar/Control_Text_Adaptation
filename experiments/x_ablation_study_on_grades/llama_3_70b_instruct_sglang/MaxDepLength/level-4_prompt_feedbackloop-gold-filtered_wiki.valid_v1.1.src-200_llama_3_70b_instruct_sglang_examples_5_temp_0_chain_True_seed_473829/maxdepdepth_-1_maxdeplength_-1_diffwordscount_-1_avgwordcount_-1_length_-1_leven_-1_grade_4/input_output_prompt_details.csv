It seems that I was unable to achieve a maximum dependency length of exactly 5 with the previous rewrites. I will continue to revise the sentence until the criteria are met.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to achieve a maximum dependency length of exactly 5 while maintaining the original meaning and grammatical correctness. However, I will continue to try and find a solution.  If you would like, I can provide alternative rewrites that may not meet the exact maximum dependency length of 5 but still convey the original meaning and are grammatically correct. Please let me know how I can assist further.  Alternatively, I can try to break down the sentence into smaller parts and rewrite each part to meet the maximum dependency length of 5. This may result in multiple sentences, but each sentence would meet the criteria.

After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to meet the exact maximum dependency length of 7 while maintaining the original meaning. However, I can try to get closer to the target. Here is another revised attempt:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Al Gharafa, Qatar's champions, have won titles in a row. They are known as Al Fhoud or Lepords in a specific region.}  Rewritten sentence's Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ["(0, 'won') [(1, 'Gharafa') [(1, 'Al')] (3, 'titles') [(1, 'in') [(2, 'row') [(1, 'a')]]]]", "(0, 'known') [(3, 'They') (2, 'are') (1, 'as') [(2, 'Fhoud') [(1, 'Al') (1, 'or') (2, 'Lepords')]] (4, 'in') [(2,'region') [(1, 'a') (1,'specific')]]]"]  The maximum dependency length for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" is 4, which is still not meeting the requested value of exactly 7. I will continue to revise the sentence until it meets the criteria.	number_of_examples_found: 5	prompt: [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert in text adaptation, skilled at meticulously rewriting texts to align with requested linguistic features while preserving the original meaning.
