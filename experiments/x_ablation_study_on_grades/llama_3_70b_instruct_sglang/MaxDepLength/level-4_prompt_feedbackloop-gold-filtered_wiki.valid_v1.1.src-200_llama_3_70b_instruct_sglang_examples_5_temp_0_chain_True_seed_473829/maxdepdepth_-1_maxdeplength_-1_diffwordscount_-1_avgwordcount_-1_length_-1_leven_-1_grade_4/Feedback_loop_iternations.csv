After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to meet the maximum dependency length of exactly 6 while maintaining the original meaning. The sentence structure and word choice are limiting the possibilities.  However, I'll continue to try and find a solution. If you could provide more context or flexibility in the rewriting criteria, I may be able to find a solution that meets the requirements.  Alternatively, I can try to rewrite the sentence in a different way, but it may not exactly convey the same meaning. Please let me know if you would like me to explore alternative rewrites.
