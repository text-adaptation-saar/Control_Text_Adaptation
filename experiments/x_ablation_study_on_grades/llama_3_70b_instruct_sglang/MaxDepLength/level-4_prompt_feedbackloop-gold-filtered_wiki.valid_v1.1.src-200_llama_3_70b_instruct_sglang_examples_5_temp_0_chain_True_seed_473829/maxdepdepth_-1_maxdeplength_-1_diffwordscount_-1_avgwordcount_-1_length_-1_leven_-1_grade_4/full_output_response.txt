I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to achieve a maximum dependency length of exactly 5 with the previous rewrites. I will continue to revise the sentence until the criteria are met.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to achieve a maximum dependency length of exactly 5 while maintaining the original meaning and grammatical correctness. However, I will continue to try and find a solution.  If you would like, I can provide alternative rewrites that may not meet the exact maximum dependency length of 5 but still convey the original meaning and are grammatically correct. Please let me know how I can assist further.  Alternatively, I can try to break down the sentence into smaller parts and rewrite each part to meet the maximum dependency length of 5. This may result in multiple sentences, but each sentence would meet the criteria.  Please let me know how I can proceed.
