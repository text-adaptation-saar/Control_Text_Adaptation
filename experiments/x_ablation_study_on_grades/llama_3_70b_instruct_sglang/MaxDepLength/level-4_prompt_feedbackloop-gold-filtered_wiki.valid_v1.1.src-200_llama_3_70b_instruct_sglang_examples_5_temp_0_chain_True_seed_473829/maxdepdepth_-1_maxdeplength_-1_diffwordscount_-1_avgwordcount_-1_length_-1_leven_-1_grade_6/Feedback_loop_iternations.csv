line_number, 1, iternation, 8, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to meet the maximum dependency length of exactly 7 in my previous attempts. I will make sure to revise the sentence again to meet the requirements.  However, I would like to clarify that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to meet the exact maximum dependency length of 7 while maintaining the original meaning and grammatical correctness. The sentence structure and word choice play a significant role in determining the dependency length, and it's not always possible to achieve a specific dependency length without compromising the sentence's clarity or accuracy.  If you could provide more guidance or flexibility on the maximum dependency length or sentence structure, I would be happy to try again to meet your requirements.

line_number, 5, iternation, 7, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I made an error in my previous attempts. I will continue to try to rephrase the sentence until the criteria are satisfactorily met.  After rephrasing the sentence multiple times, I was unable to meet the exact maximum dependency length of 10. The rewritten sentences either exceeded or fell short of the requested value.  If you would like, I can provide more attempts at rewriting the sentence to meet the maximum dependency length of 10. Please let me know how I can further assist.  Alternatively, I can try to break down the sentence into simpler sentences that meet the maximum dependency length of 10. For example:  Rewritten sentence(s): {It is part of the Trans-Karakoram Tract. The Tract has been claimed by India for a long time.}  Please let me know if this meets the requirements or if I should continue to try to rephrase the sentence.

line_number, 116, iternation, 10, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to achieve a maximum dependency length of 7 with the previous attempts. I will continue to revise the sentence until the criteria are satisfactorily met.  However, I would like to clarify that it's challenging to achieve a maximum dependency length of 7 with the given sentence, as it may result in a sentence that is not grammatically correct or does not convey the same meaning as the original sentence.  If possible, could you provide more guidance or examples of sentences with a maximum dependency length of 7? This will help me better understand the requirements and generate a revised sentence that meets the criteria.  Alternatively, I can try to break down the sentence into smaller parts and rephrase them to achieve a maximum dependency length of 7. However, this may result in a sentence that is not grammatically correct or does not convey the same meaning as the original sentence.  Please let me know how I can proceed to meet the requirements.
