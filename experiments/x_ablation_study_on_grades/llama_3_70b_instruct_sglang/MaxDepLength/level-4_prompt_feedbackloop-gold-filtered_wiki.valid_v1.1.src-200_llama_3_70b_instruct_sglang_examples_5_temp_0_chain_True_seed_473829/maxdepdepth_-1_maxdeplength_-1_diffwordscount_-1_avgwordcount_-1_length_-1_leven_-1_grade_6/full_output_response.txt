I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to achieve a maximum dependency length of 7 with the previous attempts. I will continue to revise the sentence until the criteria are satisfactorily met.  However, I would like to clarify that it's challenging to achieve a maximum dependency length of 7 with the given sentence, as it may result in a sentence that is not grammatically correct or does not convey the same meaning as the original sentence.  If possible, could you provide more guidance or examples of sentences with a maximum dependency length of 7? This will help me better understand the requirements and generate a revised sentence that meets the criteria.  Alternatively, I can try to break down the sentence into smaller parts and rephrase them to achieve a maximum dependency length of 7. However, this may result in a sentence that is not grammatically correct or does not convey the same meaning as the original sentence.  Please let me know how I can proceed to meet the requirements.
