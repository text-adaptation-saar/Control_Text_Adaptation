I apologize for the mistake. Here is the revised rewritten sentence with a maximum dependency length of exactly 6:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Born in Munich, Baader was a high school dropout and a criminal. He was involved in the RAF before that specific time frame now.}  Rewritten sentence's Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ["(0, 'Born') [(1, 'in') [(1, 'Munich') [(2, 'Baader')]] (5, 'was') [(4, 'dropout') [(3, 'a') (1,'school') [(1, 'high')] (1, 'and') (3, 'criminal') [(1, 'a')]]]]", "(0, 'involved') [(2, 'He') (1, 'was') (1, 'in') [(2, 'RAF') [(1, 'the')]] (4, 'before') [(5, 'now') [(6, 'frame') [(5, 'that') [(4,'specific') (3, 'time')]]]]]"]  The maximum dependency length for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" is 6. This meets the requested value of exactly 6.
