I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I need to re-examine the sentence structure to meet the maximum dependency length of exactly 9. Unfortunately, I was unable to find a rewritten sentence that meets the exact maximum dependency length of 9.

However, I would like to request clarification on whether it's possible to relax the constraint on the maximum dependency length or provide more guidance on how to achieve a dependency length of 9. If not, I can try to rewrite the sentence in a different way to make it more concise and clear, even if it doesn't meet the exact maximum dependency length of 9.
