line_number, 45, iternation, 7, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I'm having trouble finding a rewritten sentence that meets the exact maximum dependency length of 4 while maintaining the original meaning. The sentence structure and word choice seem to inherently require a longer dependency length.  After several attempts, I was unable to find a rewritten sentence that meets the exact maximum dependency length of 4. If you would like, I can try to provide an explanation for why this might be the case.  Alternatively, I can try to provide a rewritten sentence that is as close to the maximum dependency length of 4 as possible, while still maintaining the original meaning. Please let me know if this is acceptable.
