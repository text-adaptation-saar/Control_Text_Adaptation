line_number, 49, iternation, 7, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to create a rewritten sentence with a maximum dependency length of exactly 4. I will continue to try until I meet the criteria.  Could you please provide more guidance or examples of sentences with a maximum dependency length of 4? This will help me better understand the requirements and create a rewritten sentence that meets the criteria.  Alternatively, I can try to break down the original sentence into smaller parts and rephrase each part to create a new sentence with a maximum dependency length of 4. Please let me know if this is an acceptable approach.

This meets the requested value of exactly 11.  Please let me know if this revised sentence meets the requirements.
line_number, 116, iternation, 10, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to achieve a maximum dependency length of 11 in the previous attempts. I will make another attempt to revise the sentence to meet the requirements.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to achieve a maximum dependency length of exactly 11 while maintaining the original meaning and structure of the sentence. The sentence is complex, and the dependencies are deeply nested, making it difficult to reduce the maximum dependency length to 11.  However, I will try to simplify the sentence and break it down into smaller clauses to reduce the dependency length. Here is another attempt:  Rewritten sentence(s): {The articles were signed and then posted in a prominent place at the door of the grand cabin. Many people, including officials, guests, and others, saw them at this location.}  Rewritten sentence's Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ["(0,'signed') [(2, 'articles') [(1, 'The')] (1, 'were') (1, 'and') (3, 'posted') [(1, 'then') (1, 'in') [(3, 'place') [(2, 'a') (1, 'prominent')]] (5, 'at') [(2, 'door') [(1, 'the') (1, 'of') [(3, 'cabin') [(2, 'the') (1, 'grand')]]]]]]", "(0,'saw') [(1, 'people') [(1, 'Many')] (2, 'including') [(1, 'officials') [(2, 'guests') [(2, 'and') (3, 'others')]]] (3, 'them') (4, 'at') [(5, 'location') [(1, 'this')]]]"]  The maximum dependency length for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" is 5. This is still not meeting the requested value of exactly 11. I will continue to revise the sentence until the criteria are satisfactorily met.  Please let me know if I should continue to revise the sentence or if you would like to provide further guidance.

I will continue to revise the sentence to meet the exact requirement.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rephrase the original sentence to meet the maximum dependency length of exactly 7 while maintaining its original meaning. The sentence structure and word choice are crucial in determining the dependency length, and it's not always possible to achieve a specific dependency length without altering the sentence's meaning or clarity.  If you could provide more guidance or flexibility on the rewriting criteria, I would be happy to try again. Alternatively, I can assist you in rewriting the sentence to improve its clarity and readability while maintaining its original meaning, even if it doesn't meet the exact dependency length requirement.
