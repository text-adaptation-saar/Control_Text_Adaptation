I apologize for the mistake. I understand that I was unable to create a sentence with a maximum dependency length of exactly 11 that meets the original sentence's meaning and structure. I will try again, and this time, I will rephrase the sentence to meet the maximum dependency length of 11.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to simplify the sentence while maintaining its meaning and structure. The original sentence is quite complex, and it's difficult to reduce its dependency length to 11 without losing its meaning.  However, I will try to provide a rewritten sentence that meets the maximum dependency length of 11, even if it means sacrificing some of the original sentence's complexity:  Rewritten sentence(s): {The court hears cases from the Superior State Labour Courts, which hear cases against decisions made by the Inferior State Labour Courts, involving some issues.}  Wait, I apologize for the mistake again. This sentence still has a maximum dependency length of 15, not 11.  I apologize, but I was unable to create a sentence with a maximum dependency length of exactly 11 that meets the original sentence's meaning and structure. The original sentence is quite complex, and it's challenging to simplify it while maintaining its meaning and structure. If you would like, I can try to simplify the sentence further, but it may lose some of its original meaning.  Please let me know how I can assist you further.

I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to achieve a maximum dependency length of 11 in the previous attempts. I will make another attempt to revise the sentence to meet the requirements.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to achieve a maximum dependency length of exactly 11 while maintaining the original meaning and structure of the sentence. The sentence is complex, and the dependencies are deeply nested, making it difficult to reduce the maximum dependency length to 11.  However, I will try to simplify the sentence and break it down into smaller clauses to reduce the dependency length.

Additionally, I would like to ask if it's possible to relax the constraint of maintaining the original meaning of the sentence. Would it be acceptable to rephrase the sentence in a way that conveys the same general idea but with a different wording? This might allow me to generate a sentence that meets the maximum dependency length requirement of 7.  Please let me know if there's any flexibility in the requirements or if you have any further guidance to offer. I'll do my best to generate a rewritten sentence that meets the criteria.
