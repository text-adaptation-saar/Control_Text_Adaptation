I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to reach a maximum dependency length of exactly 5 while maintaining the original meaning of the sentence. I will continue to revise the sentence until the criteria are satisfactorily met.  However, I would like to clarify that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to meet the exact maximum dependency length of 5 while preserving the original meaning. The sentence structure and word choice are limited by the constraints of the original sentence.  If possible, could you provide more context or flexibility in the rewriting criteria? Alternatively, I can try to provide a rewritten sentence that approximates the maximum dependency length of 5 while still conveying the original meaning.  Please let me know how I can proceed.
