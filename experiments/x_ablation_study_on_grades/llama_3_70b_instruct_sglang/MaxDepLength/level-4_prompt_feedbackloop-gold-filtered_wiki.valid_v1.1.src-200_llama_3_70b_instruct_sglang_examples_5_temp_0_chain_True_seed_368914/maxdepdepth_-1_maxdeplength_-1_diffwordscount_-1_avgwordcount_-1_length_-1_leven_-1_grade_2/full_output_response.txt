If you could provide more guidance or clarification, I would be happy to try again.
I apologize for the mistake. Here is the revised rewritten sentence:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Thumper is a song by Raging Speedhorn on their album.}  Rewritten sentence's Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ["(0, 'is') [(1, 'Thumper') (2,'song') [(1, 'a') (1, 'by') [(2, 'Speedhorn') [(1, 'Raging')]]] (4, 'on') [(2, 'album') [(1, 'their')]]]"]  The maximum dependency length for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree", is 4. This meets the requested value of exactly 4.
I apologize for the mistake. Here is the revised rewritten sentence(s) with a maximum dependency length of exactly 4:  Rewritten sentence(s): {FNMTV was a music show. It aired new music video content.}  Rewritten sentence's Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ["(0, 'was') [(1, 'FNMTV') (3,'show') [(2, 'a') (1,'music')]]", "(0, 'aired') [(1, 'It') (2, 'new') (3,'music') (4, 'content')]"]  The maximum dependency length for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" is 4. This meets the requested value of exactly 4.
I apologize for the mistake. I will make another attempt to revise the sentence with a maximum dependency length of exactly 5.  Rewritten sentence(s): {Marguerite gave up her rights to this specific contract.} Rewritten sentence's Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ["(0, 'gave') [(1, 'Marguerite')] (2, 'up') [(1, 'her')] (3, 'rights') (4, 'to') [(5, 'this') (1,'specific') (1, 'contract')]]" The maximum dependency length for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree", is 5. This meets the requested value of exactly 5.  Please let me know if this revised sentence meets the requirements.
I apologize for the mistake. Here is the revised rewritten sentence:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Baader was born in Munich and was a dropout. He was a criminal before RAF.}  Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency length = maximum value in "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max(["(0, 'was') [(1, 'Baader') (2, 'born') [(1, 'in') [(1, 'Munich')] (2, 'and') [(2, 'dropout') [(1, 'a')]]]]", "(0, 'was') [(1, 'He') (2, 'criminal') [(1, 'before') [(2, 'RAF')]]]"]) = 4  The rewritten sentence(s) now hold a maximum dependency length of exactly 4, meeting the requested criteria.
