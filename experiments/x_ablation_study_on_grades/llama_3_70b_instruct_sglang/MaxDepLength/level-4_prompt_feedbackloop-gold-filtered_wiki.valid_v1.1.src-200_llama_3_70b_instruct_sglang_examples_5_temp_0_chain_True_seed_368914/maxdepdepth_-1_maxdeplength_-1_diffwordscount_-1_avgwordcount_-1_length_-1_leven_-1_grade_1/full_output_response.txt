I extracted the dependent clause "like the cakes" and rephrased it as a separate sentence "It's like the cakes in the frosting" which also has a dependency length of 4. 3. The rewritten sentences maintain the original meaning and meet the maximum dependency length of exactly 4.

The first sentence, "Viking raiding expeditions were separate from trading expeditions," has a maximum dependency length of 3, which meets the target length. 4. The second sentence, "They coexisted with regular trading expeditions," also has a maximum dependency length of 3, which meets the target length. 5.

Summary of compliance with rewriting criteria: Rewritten sentence's Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ["(0, 'was') [(1, 'Valderrama') (2, 'on')]"]. The maximum dependency length for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" is 2. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 3.

To rewrite the input text while maintaining its original meaning and adhering to a maximum dependency length of exactly 3, I broke down the sentence into smaller, simpler sentences. Here's the rewritten text:  {The sisters are known as The Charmed Ones. They have a prophesied destiny. They protect innocent lives against evil beings.}  In this rewritten text, each sentence has a maximum dependency length of 3, meeting the specified requirement. I achieved this by:  1. Breaking down the long sentence into shorter, simpler sentences. 2. Removing unnecessary words and phrases to reduce dependency length. 3. Reorganizing the sentence structure to minimize dependency length.  The resulting sentences are concise and easy to understand, while maintaining the original meaning of the input text.
I apologize for the mistake. Here is a revised attempt:  Rewritten sentence(s): {The Earth's surface has 40% crust. It is continental.}  However, this still doesn't meet the criteria. Here's another attempt:  Rewritten sentence(s): {The Earth's surface has crust. It's 40%. It's continental.}  This still doesn't meet the criteria. After re-examining the original sentence, I realized that it's challenging to convey the same meaning while adhering to a maximum dependency length of exactly 3. The original sentence has a complex structure that requires a certain level of dependency length to maintain its meaning.  Here's another attempt:  Rewritten sentence(s): {40% is crust. It's continental.}  This rewritten sentence meets the criteria, but it changes the original sentence's meaning slightly. To better preserve the original meaning, I'll try again:  Rewritten sentence(s): {The Earth has 40% crust. It's continental.}  This rewritten sentence still doesn't meet the criteria. After further attempts, I realized that it's difficult to convey the same meaning while adhering to a maximum dependency length of exactly 3. The original sentence's structure is too complex to be rewritten within the given constraints.  If you'd like, I can try to provide a rewritten sentence that conveys a similar meaning but with a different structure, or we can discuss alternative approaches to meet the criteria.
