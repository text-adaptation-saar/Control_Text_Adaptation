After re-examining the original sentence, I realized that it's challenging to convey the same meaning while adhering to a maximum dependency length of exactly 3. The original sentence has a complex structure that requires a certain level of dependency length to maintain its meaning.  Here's another attempt:  Rewritten sentence(s): {40% is crust.
