line_number, 61, iternation, 7, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to create a sentence with a maximum dependency length of exactly 4. I will make sure to revise my approach and try again.  Could you please provide more guidance or examples of sentences with a maximum dependency length of exactly 4? This will help me better understand the requirements and create a revised sentence that meets the criteria.  Alternatively, I can try to break down the original sentence into simpler sentences with a maximum dependency length of exactly 4. For example:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Fertile soil allowed farmers to grow crops. Fertile soil is good for many crops.}  Please let me know if this approach is acceptable or if I should continue to try to create a single sentence with a maximum dependency length of exactly 4.

line_number, 133, iternation, 4, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to find a rewritten sentence that meets the criteria of a maximum dependency length of exactly 4. I will continue to try to find a solution.  After re-examining the original sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rewrite it to meet the exact maximum dependency length of 4 while preserving the original meaning. The sentence structure and word choice are crucial in achieving this goal.  If you could provide more context or relax the constraint on the maximum dependency length, I may be able to find a rewritten sentence that meets your requirements. Alternatively, I can try to suggest a rewritten sentence that approximates the original meaning while minimizing the dependency length.  Please let me know how I can assist you further.
