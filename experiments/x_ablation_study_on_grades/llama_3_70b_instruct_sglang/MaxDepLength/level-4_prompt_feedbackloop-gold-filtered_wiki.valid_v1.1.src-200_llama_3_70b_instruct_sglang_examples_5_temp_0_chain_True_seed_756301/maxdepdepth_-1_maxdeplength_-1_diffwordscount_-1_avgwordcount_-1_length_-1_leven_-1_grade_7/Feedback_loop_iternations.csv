line_number, 14, iternation, 7, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I made an error in my previous attempts. After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to meet the exact maximum dependency length of 7 while preserving the original meaning.  However, I'll continue to try and find a solution. If you could provide more context or relax the constraint on the maximum dependency length, I may be able to provide a rewritten sentence that meets your requirements.  Alternatively, I can try to rewrite the sentence in a way that minimizes the maximum dependency length while still conveying the original meaning. Please let me know if that's an acceptable approach.
