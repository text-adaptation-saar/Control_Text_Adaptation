I will make sure to revise the sentence again to meet the requirements.  However, I would like to clarify that it's challenging to increase the dependency length of a sentence while maintaining its grammatical correctness and clarity. The sentence structure and word choice play a significant role in determining the dependency length.  If you could provide more guidance or flexibility on the sentence structure or word choice, I would be happy to try again to meet the maximum dependency length of exactly 10.  Alternatively, I can also suggest rephrasing the sentence to improve its clarity and readability while maintaining a reasonable dependency length. Please let me know how I can assist you further.
