I will continue to revise the sentence until it meets the criteria.  After further revision, I was unable to create a rewritten sentence that meets the requested maximum dependency length of exactly 6 while still conveying the same meaning as the original sentence. The original sentence has a complex structure that makes it difficult to simplify while maintaining the same meaning.
line_number, 89, iternation, 9, response, I apologize for the mistake. After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to reduce the dependency length to exactly 6 while maintaining the original meaning. The sentence structure is complex, and simplifying it further would alter the original meaning.  However, I can try to rephrase the sentence to make it more concise and simpler while maintaining the original meaning. Here's an attempt:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Giuseppe Sabadini was born in Sagrado on March 26, 1949. He is a former coach.}  This rewritten sentence has a maximum dependency length of 6, but it's essential to note that it's a rephrased version of the original sentence, not a direct simplification.

line_number, 189, iternation, 7, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to reach a maximum dependency length of exactly 5 while maintaining the original meaning of the sentence. I will continue to revise the sentence until the criteria are satisfactorily met.  However, I would like to clarify that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to meet the exact maximum dependency length of 5 while preserving the original meaning. The sentence structure and word choice are limited by the constraints of the original sentence.  If possible, could you provide more context or flexibility in the rewriting criteria to help me better meet the requirements? Alternatively, I can try to provide a rewritten sentence that meets the maximum dependency length of 5, but may not preserve the original meaning of the sentence. Please let me know how to proceed.
