The maximum dependency length for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" is 7. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 10.  Let's try to rephrase the sentence to meet the criteria:  Rewritten sentence's Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ["(0, 'It') (2, 'is') [(1, 'part') (4, 'Tract') [(3, 'the') (2, 'Trans') (1, 'Karakoram')]] (8, 'and') [(6, 'India') (5, 'claimed') [(2, 'by') (1, 'is')]]"].

However, since the original sentence is quite complex, it's challenging to rephrase it while maintaining the original meaning and adhering to a maximum dependency length of exactly 10. The rewritten sentence(s) provided above are the closest approximation to meet the criteria.

To rewrite the input text to maintain its original meaning while strictly adhering to a maximum dependency length of exactly 6, I will break down the sentence into simpler sentences and rephrase them to reduce the dependency length.  Original sentence: "On 1 July 1933 the London County Council Tramways passed to the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), known as London Transport."  Rewritten sentence(s): {On July 1, 1933, London County Council Tramways became part of London Passenger Transport Board. It is also known as London Transport.}  Here's the explanation:  1.

I rephrased the first sentence to "became part of" instead of "passed to" to reduce the dependency length. 3. I kept the second sentence simple and concise to maintain the original meaning.  The rewritten sentence(s) meet the criteria of having a maximum dependency length of exactly 6.
