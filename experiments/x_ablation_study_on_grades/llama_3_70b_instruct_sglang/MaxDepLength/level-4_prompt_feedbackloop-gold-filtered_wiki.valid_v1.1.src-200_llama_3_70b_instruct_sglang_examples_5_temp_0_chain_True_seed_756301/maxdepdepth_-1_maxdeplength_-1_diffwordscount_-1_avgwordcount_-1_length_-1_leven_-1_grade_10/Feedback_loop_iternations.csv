line_number, 16, iternation, 9, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to meet the maximum dependency length of 11 in my previous attempts. I will make sure to revise the sentence again to meet the requirements.  However, I would like to clarify that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to meet the exact maximum dependency length of 11 while maintaining the original meaning and grammatical correctness. The sentence structure and word choice play a significant role in determining the dependency length, and it's not always possible to achieve a specific length without compromising the sentence's clarity or accuracy.  If you could provide more guidance or flexibility on the maximum dependency length, I would be happy to try again. Alternatively, I can suggest a rewritten sentence that meets the original meaning and grammatical correctness, even if it doesn't exactly meet the maximum dependency length of 11.  Please let me know how I can assist you further.

The original sentence is already quite concise, and rephrasing it to meet the exact dependency length of 14 would likely result in a sentence that is less clear or less concise.

line_number, 113, iternation, 10, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I was unable to create a rewritten sentence with a maximum dependency length of exactly 7. I will make sure to revise the sentence again to meet the specific requirements.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to create a rewritten sentence with a maximum dependency length of exactly 7 while maintaining the original meaning and structure of the sentence. The sentence has a complex structure with multiple clauses and phrases, making it difficult to reduce the dependency length to 7.  If you could provide more guidance or flexibility on the rewriting criteria, I would be happy to try again. Alternatively, I can suggest a rewritten sentence with a simpler structure that meets the maximum dependency length of 7, but it may not convey the same meaning as the original sentence.  Please let me know how I can assist you further.
