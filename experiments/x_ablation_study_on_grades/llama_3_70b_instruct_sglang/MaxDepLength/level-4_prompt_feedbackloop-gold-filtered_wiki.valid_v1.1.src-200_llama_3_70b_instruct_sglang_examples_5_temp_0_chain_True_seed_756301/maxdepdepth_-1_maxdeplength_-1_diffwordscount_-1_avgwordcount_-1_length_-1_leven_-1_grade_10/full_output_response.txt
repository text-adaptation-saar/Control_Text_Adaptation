I will make sure to revise the sentence again to meet the specific requirements.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to create a rewritten sentence with a maximum dependency length of exactly 7 while maintaining the original meaning and structure of the sentence. The sentence has a complex structure with multiple clauses and phrases, making it difficult to reduce the dependency length to 7.  If you could provide more guidance or flexibility on the rewriting criteria, I would be happy to try again. Alternatively, I can suggest a rewritten sentence with a simpler structure that meets the maximum dependency length of 7, but it may not convey the same meaning as the original sentence.  Please let me know how I can assist you further.
