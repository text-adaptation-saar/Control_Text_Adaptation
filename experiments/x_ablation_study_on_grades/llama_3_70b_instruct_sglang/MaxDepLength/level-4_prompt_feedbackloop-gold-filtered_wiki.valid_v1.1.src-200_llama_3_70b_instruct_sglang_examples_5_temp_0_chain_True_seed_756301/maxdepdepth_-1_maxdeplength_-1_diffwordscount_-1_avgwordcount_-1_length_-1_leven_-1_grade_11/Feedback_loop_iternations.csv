line_number, 94, iternation, 9, response, I apologize for the mistake. It seems that I'm still having trouble creating a sentence with a maximum dependency length of exactly 5. I will continue to try until I meet the criteria.  Could you please provide more guidance or examples of sentences with a maximum dependency length of 5? This will help me better understand the requirements and create a rewritten sentence that meets the criteria.  Alternatively, I can try to break down the sentence into smaller parts and rephrase it to meet the maximum dependency length of 5. Please let me know if this is an acceptable approach.  I will continue to revise and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. Thank you for your patience and feedback.
