input_src: Broadcast out of the same building is 105.7 The River, which is also networked to local stations around New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia.	output: To rewrite the input text to maintain its original meaning while strictly adhering to a maximum dependency length of exactly 4, I will break down the sentence into smaller clauses and rephrase them to reduce the dependency length.  Original sentence: "Broadcast out of the same building is 105.7 The River, which is also networked to local stations around New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia."  Rewritten sentence(s): {The broadcast is from the same building. It is 105.7 The River. This station is networked to local stations in New South Wales. It is also networked to stations in Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia.}  Here's the explanation for each rewritten sentence:  1. "The broadcast is from the same building." - This sentence has a dependency length of 4, as it only connects the subject "broadcast" to the prepositional phrase "from the same building". 2. "It is 105.7 The River." - This sentence has a dependency length of 3, as it only connects the subject "it" to the predicate "105.7 The River". 3. "This station is networked to local stations in New South Wales." - This sentence has a dependency length of 4, as it connects the subject "station" to the verb "is networked" and the prepositional phrase "to local stations in New South Wales". 4. "It is also networked to stations in Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia." - This sentence has a dependency length of 4, as it connects the subject "it" to the verb "is networked" and the prepositional phrase "to stations in Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia".  By breaking down the original sentence into smaller clauses, I was able to reduce the dependency length to 4 or less for each sentence, while maintaining the original meaning of the text.	number_of_examples_found: 5	prompt: [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert in text adaptation, skilled at meticulously rewriting texts to align with requested linguistic features while preserving the original meaning.

It seems that I was unable to meet the criteria of a maximum dependency length of exactly 3. I will continue to revise and try to meet the criteria.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to meet the exact maximum dependency length of 3 while maintaining the original meaning. The sentence structure and word choice are crucial in determining the dependency length, and it's not always possible to achieve a specific dependency length without altering the sentence's meaning or clarity.  If you could provide more guidance or flexibility on the rewriting criteria, I would be happy to try again. Alternatively, I can provide a rewritten sentence that meets the original meaning and is clear, but may not exactly meet the maximum dependency length of 3.  Please let me know how I can proceed.	number_of_examples_found: 5	prompt: [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert in text adaptation, skilled at meticulously rewriting texts to align with requested linguistic features while preserving the original meaning.
