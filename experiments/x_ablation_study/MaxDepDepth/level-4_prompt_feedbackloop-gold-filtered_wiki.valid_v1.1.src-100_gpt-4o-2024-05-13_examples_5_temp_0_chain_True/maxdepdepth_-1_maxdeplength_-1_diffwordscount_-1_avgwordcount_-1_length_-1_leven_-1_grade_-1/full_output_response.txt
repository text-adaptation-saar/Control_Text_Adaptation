"In 1929 and 1930, he played with Irving Aaronson's Commanders." - Depth: 4 (played -> with -> Commanders -> Aaronson's)  2. "There, he was exposed to symphonic music." - Depth: 4 (was -> exposed -> to -> music)  3. "He later incorporated this in his arrangements." - Depth: 4 (incorporated -> this -> in -> arrangements)  Each sentence conforms to the maximum depth of 4.
