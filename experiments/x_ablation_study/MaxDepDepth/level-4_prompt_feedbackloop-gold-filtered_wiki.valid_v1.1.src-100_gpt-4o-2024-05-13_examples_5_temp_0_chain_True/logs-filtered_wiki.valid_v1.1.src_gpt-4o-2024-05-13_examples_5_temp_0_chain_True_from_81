system_prompt: You are an expert in text adaptation, skilled at meticulously rewriting texts to align with requested linguistic features while preserving the original meaning. Your task is to rewrite the provided Input Text to maintain its original meaning while strictly adhering to the specified maximum depth of the dependency tree.
Here, maximum depth of the dependency tree indicates the largest number of hierarchical levels from the root word (typically the main verb) to the deepest node in the sentence, indicating the most complex relationship chain in the grammatical structure.
If the rewrite requires multiple sentences, each must conform to the specified maximum dependency tree depth. 
Phrasing or structure modifications are permissible, as long as the essential meaning is retained. 
Ensure each sentence rigorously conforms to the specified constraints, utilizing your extensive knowledge in linguistics, without fabricating any responses.
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.
user_prompt: Input Text: {input_src}

Input text’s Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: {print_dependency_tree_with_depth}.
The maximum depth of dependency tree of the input text, as determined by the highest value in its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" is {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The input text currently holds a maximum dependency depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.

Rewrite the input text to maintain its original meaning while strictly adhering to a maximum depth of the dependency tree of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Let's think through this step by step. Solve each step and explain how you arrived at your answer. 
Always output all the rewritten sentence(s) within one curly brace.

Summary of compliance with rewriting criteria:
Rewritten sentence(s): {{output_text}}
Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

Rewritten sentence(s): {{output_text}}
Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

Rewritten sentence(s): {{output_text}}
Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

Rewritten sentence(s): {{output_text}}
Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

Rewritten sentence(s): {{output_text}}
Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met.

 Output_give_by_OpenAI_chatmodel: To rewrite the input text while maintaining its original meaning and adhering to a maximum dependency tree depth of 4, we need to simplify the sentence structure. Here is the step-by-step process:  1. Identify the main clauses and break them down into simpler sentences. 2. Ensure each sentence has a maximum dependency tree depth of 4.  Rewritten sentence(s):  {In 1929 and 1930, he played with Irving Aaronson's Commanders. There, he was exposed to symphonic music. He later incorporated this in his arrangements.}  Let's verify the dependency tree depth for each sentence:  1. "In 1929 and 1930, he played with Irving Aaronson's Commanders." - Depth: 4 (played -> with -> Commanders -> Aaronson's)  2. "There, he was exposed to symphonic music." - Depth: 4 (was -> exposed -> to -> music)  3. "He later incorporated this in his arrangements." - Depth: 4 (incorporated -> this -> in -> arrangements)  Each sentence conforms to the maximum depth of 4.

Summary of compliance with rewriting criteria:
Rewritten sentence(s): {{output_text}}
Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met.

Rewritten sentence(s): {{output_text}}
Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

Rewritten sentence(s): {{output_text}}
Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

Rewritten sentence(s): {{output_text}}
Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

Rewritten sentence(s): {{output_text}}
Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

Summary of compliance with rewriting criteria:
Rewritten sentence(s): {{output_text}}
Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

Rewritten sentence(s): {{output_text}}
Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

Summary of compliance with rewriting criteria:
Rewritten sentence(s): {{output_text}}
Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met.

Summary of compliance with rewriting criteria:
Rewritten sentence(s): {{output_text}}
Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

Summary of compliance with rewriting criteria:
Rewritten sentence(s): {{output_text}}
Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

Rewritten sentence(s): {{output_text}}
Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

Summary of compliance with rewriting criteria:
Rewritten sentence(s): {{output_text}}
Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

Rewritten sentence(s): {{output_text}}
Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max({print_dependency_tree_with_depth}) = {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence with a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.
