The Province of Bari is a province in the Apulia region of Italy. 2. Its capital is the city of Bari.  The key information in the first sentence is the location of the Province of Bari, and in the second sentence, it's the capital of the province.  **Step 2: Determine the target word count per sentence** The target word count per sentence is 11 words.  **Step 3: Rewrite the first sentence to meet the 11-word count** The original sentence has 12 words. To reduce it to 11 words, I'll rephrase the sentence while maintaining the original meaning:  The Province of Bari is a province in Apulia, Italy region.  This rewritten sentence has 11 words: ['The', 'Province', 'of', 'Bari', 'is', 'a', 'province', 'in', 'Apulia,', 'Italy','region'].  **Step 4: Rewrite the second sentence to meet the 11-word count** The original sentence has 9 words. To increase it to 11 words, I'll rephrase the sentence while maintaining the original meaning:  The capital of the Province of Bari is the city Bari.  This rewritten sentence has 11 words: ['The', 'capital', 'of', 'the', 'Province', 'of', 'Bari', 'is', 'the', 'city', 'Bari'].  **Step 5: Combine the rewritten sentences** Here is the final output:  {The Province of Bari is a province in Apulia, Italy region.

Step 2: Determine the essential words that convey the main idea: The essential words are: "Alice", "Disney", "Carroll", and "film".  Step 3: Create individual sentences using one word each: Since we need to use only one word per sentence, we can create the following sentences:  {Alice} {Disney} {Carroll} {Film}  These sentences meet the requirement of having only one word per sentence. However, they do not convey the complete meaning of the original text.  Step 4: Add more sentences to convey the complete meaning: To add more context, we can create additional sentences using one word each:  {American} {Animated}  These sentences provide more information about the film.  Step 5: Combine the sentences to convey the complete meaning: The final rewritten text with one word per sentence is:  {Alice} {Disney} {Carroll} {Film} {American} {Animated}  This output meets the requirement of having one word per sentence, and it conveys the main idea of the original text.	number_of_examples_found: 0	prompt: [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert in text adaptation, skilled at meticulously rewriting texts to align with requested linguistic features while preserving the original meaning.

input_src: It was the ancient capital of Cerdanya in antiquity, before being replaced by Hix (commune of Bourg-Madame, France) in the Middle Ages.	output: Let's break down the task step by step.  **Step 1: Identify the main ideas in the input text** The input text conveys two main ideas:  1. The ancient capital of Cerdanya was replaced. 2. The replacement occurred in the Middle Ages, and the new capital is Hix (commune of Bourg-Madame, France).  **Step 2: Determine the number of sentences required** To meet the 10-word count per sentence requirement, we may need to split the input text into two sentences. This is because the original text has 22 words, which is more than twice the target word count.  **Step 3: Rewrite the first sentence** The first sentence should convey the idea that the ancient capital of Cerdanya was replaced. Here's a possible rewrite:  {Cerdanya's ancient capital was replaced in the Middle Ages.}  This sentence has 9 words, which is close to the target count. Let's move on to the second sentence.  **Step 4: Rewrite the second sentence** The second sentence should convey the idea that the new capital is Hix (commune of Bourg-Madame, France).

This means we might need to split the original sentence into two or more sentences to meet the word count requirement.  **Step 2: Identify the main ideas** The main ideas in the input text are:  1. Fishermen are using plastic bait. 2. They are also using electronic lures. 3. The purpose is to attract fish.  **Step 3: Rewrite the sentences** To meet the 8-word count requirement, I'll create two sentences:  1. Fishermen use plastic bait to catch fish. 2. They also use electronic lures for attraction.  **Step 4: Verify the word count** Let's count the words in each sentence:  1. Fishermen use plastic bait to catch fish. * Fishermen (1) * use (1) * plastic (1) * bait (1) * to (1) * catch (1) * fish (1) Total words: 7 (not 8, need to adjust) 2.

This sentence has 17 words, so I need to add one more word to meet the 18-word count requirement. I can do this by adding an adjective to describe the region: Maubec is a commune in the Vaucluse department, which is located in the beautiful Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region of France.  Step 3: Verify that the rewritten sentence meets the 18-word count requirement: The rewritten sentence has the following words: ['Maubec', 'is', 'a', 'commune', 'in', 'the', 'Vaucluse', 'department', 'which', 'is', 'located', 'in', 'the', 'beautiful', 'Provence-Alpes-Côte', 'd\'Azur','region', 'of', 'France'] The total word count is 18, which meets the requirement.

During that time, he was exposed to symphonic music, which he later incorporated into his arrangements.  **Step 2: Divide the main ideas into sentences with 8 words each** To meet the 8-word constraint, we need to rephrase the main ideas into two sentences.  **Rewritten sentence 1:** {He played with Irving Aaronson's Commanders in 1929.}  This sentence conveys the first main idea, and it has exactly 8 words.  **Rewritten sentence 2:** {He was exposed to symphonic music later incorporated.}  This sentence conveys the second main idea, but it's not clear and concise. Let's rephrase it to make it more understandable while maintaining the 8-word constraint.  **Rewritten sentence 2 (revised):** {He discovered symphonic music, later used in arrangements.}  This revised sentence is more concise and clear, and it has exactly 8 words.  **Final rewritten output:** {He played with Irving Aaronson's Commanders in 1929.
