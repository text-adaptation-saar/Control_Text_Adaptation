By rephrasing the sentence, we can simplify the dependency tree while maintaining the original meaning.

In the original text, the dependency tree has a depth of 4, with the following structure:  * Tolstoy and Dostoevsky (subject) + were titanic figures (predicate) + to the point that (subordinate clause) - many literary critics have described one or the other as the greatest novelist ever (subordinate clause)  To reduce the dependency tree to a depth of 3, I broke the sentence into two simpler sentences:  * Tolstoy and Dostoevsky were titanic figures. (subject-predicate) * Many literary critics described one or the other as the greatest novelist ever. (subject-predicate)  This rewritten text maintains the original meaning while simplifying the sentence structure to meet the dependency tree depth requirement.
