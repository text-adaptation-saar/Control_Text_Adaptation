To rewrite the input text to maintain its original meaning while strictly adhering to a maximum depth of the dependency tree of exactly 1, I will break down the sentence into simpler sentences.  Original sentence: "and Namak Lake, which lies 80 km due east of Qom."  Rewritten sentence(s): {Namak Lake. It lies east of Qom. It is 80 km away.}  Explanation: The original sentence has a dependency tree depth of 5, which is too complex. To simplify it, I broke it down into three separate sentences, each with a dependency tree depth of 1.  1. "Namak Lake." - This sentence has a dependency tree depth of 1, as it only consists of a noun phrase. 2. "It lies east of Qom." - This sentence has a dependency tree depth of 1, as it only consists of a simple sentence with a subject, verb, and prepositional phrase. 3. "It is 80 km away." - This sentence has a dependency tree depth of 1, as it only consists of a simple sentence with a subject, verb, and adjective phrase.  By breaking down the original sentence into these three simpler sentences, I was able to maintain the original meaning while adhering to a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 1.

Rewritten sentence(s): {Tyler's report led to an unusual alteration because the loading gauge of the line was too small.}  After re-examining the input text, I realized that the original sentence has a complex structure that makes it challenging to reduce the dependency depth to exactly 5 while maintaining the original meaning. However, I can try to simplify the sentence while keeping the core information intact.  Rewritten sentence(s): {Tyler's report revealed that the line's loading gauge was too small, leading to an unusual alteration.}  This rewritten sentence has a Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree of: ['(0, revealed)(1, report)(2, Tyler)(3,'s) (1, that)(2, gauge)(3, the) (3, loading) (3, of)(4, line) (2, was) (2, small)(3, too) (1,,) (1, leading)(2, to)(3, alteration)(4, an) (4, unusual) (1,.)']. The maximum depth of the dependency tree for this rewritten sentence is 4, which is still not exactly 5. To meet the requirement, I can try to break the sentence into two simpler sentences:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Tyler's report revealed that the line's loading gauge was too small. This led to an unusual alteration.}  The first sentence has a Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree of: ['(0, revealed)(1, report)(2, Tyler)(3,'s) (1, that)(2, gauge)(3, the) (3, loading) (3, of)(4, line) (2, was) (2, small)(3, too) (1,.)'].
