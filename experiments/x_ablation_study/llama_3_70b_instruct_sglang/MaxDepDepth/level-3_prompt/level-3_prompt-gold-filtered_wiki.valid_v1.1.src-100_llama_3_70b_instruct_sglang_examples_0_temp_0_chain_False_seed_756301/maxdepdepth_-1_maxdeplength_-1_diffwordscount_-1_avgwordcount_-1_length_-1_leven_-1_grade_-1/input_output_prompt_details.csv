input_src: The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated fowl.	output: {The chicken is a domesticated fowl of the species Gallus gallus domesticus.}  Explanation:  The original sentence has a maximum dependency tree depth of 3, which is due to the nested structure of the appositive phrase "(Gallus gallus domesticus)" inside the noun phrase "The chicken". To reduce the dependency tree depth to 2, I rewrote the sentence by making the appositive phrase a prepositional phrase "of the species Gallus gallus domesticus", which is attached directly to the noun "fowl". This modification flattens the dependency tree, reducing its maximum depth to 2.  The rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree would be: ['(0, is)(1, chicken)(2, The) (1, fowl)(2, a) (2, domesticated) (1, of)(2, species) (2, Gallus) (2, gallus) (2, domesticus) (1,.)']  This rewritten sentence maintains the original meaning while adhering to the specified maximum dependency tree depth of 2.	number_of_examples_found: 0	prompt: [{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are an expert in text adaptation, skilled at meticulously rewriting texts to align with requested linguistic features while preserving the original meaning.
