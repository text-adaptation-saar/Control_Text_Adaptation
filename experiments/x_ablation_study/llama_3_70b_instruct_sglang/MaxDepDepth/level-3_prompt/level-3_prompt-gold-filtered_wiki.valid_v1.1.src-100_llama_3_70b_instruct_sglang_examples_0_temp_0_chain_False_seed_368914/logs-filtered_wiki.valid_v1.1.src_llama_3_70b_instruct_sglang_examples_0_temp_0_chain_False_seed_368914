system_prompt: You are an expert in text adaptation, skilled at meticulously rewriting texts to align with requested linguistic features while preserving the original meaning. Your task is to rewrite the provided Input Text to maintain its original meaning while strictly adhering to the specified maximum depth of the dependency tree.
Here, maximum depth of the dependency tree indicates the largest number of hierarchical levels from the root word (typically the main verb) to the deepest node in the sentence, indicating the most complex relationship chain in the grammatical structure.
If the rewrite requires multiple sentences, each must conform to the specified maximum dependency tree depth. 
Phrasing or structure modifications are permissible, as long as the essential meaning is retained. 
Ensure each sentence rigorously conforms to the specified constraints, utilizing your extensive knowledge in linguistics, without fabricating any responses.
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.
user_prompt: Input Text: {input_src}

Input text’s Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: {print_dependency_tree_with_depth}.
The maximum depth of dependency tree of the input text, as determined by the highest value in its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" is {src_MaxDepDepth}.
The input text currently holds a maximum dependency depth of {src_MaxDepDepth}.

Rewrite the input text to maintain its original meaning while strictly adhering to a maximum depth of the dependency tree of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepDepth}.

Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.
output_prompt: Rewritten sentence(s): {{output_text}}

The first sentence, "Austro-Bavarian differs from Standard German sufficiently to make it difficult for native speakers to adopt standard pronunciation," has a maximum dependency tree depth of 6, as shown below:  ['(0, differs)(1, Austro-Bavarian)(2, from)(3, German)(4, Standard) (1, sufficiently) (1, to) (2, make)(3, it) (3, difficult)(4, for)(5, speakers)(6, native) (4, to) (4, adopt)(5, pronunciation)(6, standard)']  The second sentence, "In contrast to many other German dialects, this difference is significant," also has a maximum dependency tree depth of 6, as shown below:  ['(0, is)(1, difference)(2, this)(1, In)(2, contrast)(3, to)(4, dialects)(5, many) (5, other) (5, German) (1,,) (1, significant)']  Both sentences rigorously conform to the specified maximum dependency tree depth of 6, while preserving the original meaning of the input text.
