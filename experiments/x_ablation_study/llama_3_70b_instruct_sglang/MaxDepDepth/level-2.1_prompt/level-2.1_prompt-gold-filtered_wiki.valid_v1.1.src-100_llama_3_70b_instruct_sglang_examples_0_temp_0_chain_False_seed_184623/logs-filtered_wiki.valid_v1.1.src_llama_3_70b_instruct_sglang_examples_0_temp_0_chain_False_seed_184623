system_prompt: You are an expert in text adaptation, skilled at meticulously rewriting texts to align with requested linguistic features while preserving the original meaning. Your task is to rewrite the provided Input Text to maintain its original meaning while strictly adhering to the specified maximum depth of the dependency tree.
Here, maximum depth of the dependency tree indicates the largest number of hierarchical levels from the root word (typically the main verb) to the deepest node in the sentence, indicating the most complex relationship chain in the grammatical structure.
If the rewrite requires multiple sentences, each must conform to the specified maximum dependency tree depth. 
Phrasing or structure modifications are permissible, as long as the essential meaning is retained. 
Ensure each sentence rigorously conforms to the specified constraints, utilizing your extensive knowledge in linguistics, without fabricating any responses.
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.
user_prompt: Input Text: {input_src}

The costly flop of the western epic Sutter's Gold earlier in the year especially alarmed them.}  In the rewritten text, I have broken down the original sentence into two simpler sentences, each with a maximum dependency tree depth of 6. The first sentence focuses on Carl, Jr.'s spending habits alarming the stockholders, while the second sentence provides additional context about the specific event that contributed to their alarm. This restructuring maintains the original meaning while adhering to the specified dependency tree depth constraint.
