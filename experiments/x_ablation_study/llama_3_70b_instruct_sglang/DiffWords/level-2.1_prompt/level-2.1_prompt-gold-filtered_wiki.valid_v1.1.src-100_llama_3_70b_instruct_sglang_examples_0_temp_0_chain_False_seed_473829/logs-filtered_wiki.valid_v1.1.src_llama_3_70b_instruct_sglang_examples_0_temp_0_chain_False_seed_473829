system_prompt: You are an expert in text adaptation, skilled at meticulously rewriting texts to align with requested linguistic features while preserving the original meaning. Your task is to rewrite the provided Input Text to maintain its original meaning while strictly including no more than a specified number of 'difficult' words. 
Here, ’Difficult' words are defined as those not found in the Dale-Chall list, which contains about 3000 words typically understood by 4th-grade students in the U.S. 

If the rewrite requires multiple sentences, ensure the total includes no more than the specified number of 'difficult' words. 
Phrasing or structure modifications are permissible, as long as the essential meaning is retained. 
Ensure each sentence rigorously conforms to the specified constraints, utilizing your extensive knowledge in linguistics, without fabricating any responses.
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

 Output_give_by_OpenAI_chatmodel: {Valderrama played for Colombia's national soccer team in the 1990s.}  In this rewritten sentence, I've replaced "member of" with "played for" to simplify the language, and changed "football" to "soccer" to use a more common term in American English. The only two "difficult" words in this sentence are "national" and "Colombia", which are both within the allowed limit.
