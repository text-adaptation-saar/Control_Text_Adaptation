input_src: The Province of Bari is a province in the Apulia (or Puglia) region of Italy. Its capital is the city of Bari.	output: Let's break down the task step by step.  Step 1: Identify the 'difficult' words in the input text. The 'difficult' words are ['Province', 'province', 'Apulia','region'], totalling 4 'difficult' words. However, we are allowed to use only 3 'difficult' words.  Step 2: Analyze the input text and identify the essential information. The essential information is that there is an administrative area (which we can't call a 'province' since it's a 'difficult' word) in Italy, its name is Bari, and it has a capital city also called Bari.  Step 3: Rewrite the input text using simpler vocabulary while maintaining the original meaning. We can replace 'province' with 'area' and'region' with 'part'. We can't replace 'Apulia' since it's a proper noun, but we can rephrase the sentence to minimize the use of 'difficult' words.  Here's the rewritten text: {The area of Bari is in the part of Italy called Apulia. Its capital is the city of Bari.}  In this rewritten text, the 'difficult' words are ['area', 'Apulia'], totalling 2 'difficult' words. We still have one more 'difficult' word allowed, so we can use it to make the text more concise.  Step 4: Refine the rewritten text to use the allowed 'difficult' words efficiently. We can replace 'part' with'region' (which is one of the original 'difficult' words) to make the text more concise.  Here's the final rewritten text: {The area of Bari is in the Apulia region of Italy. Its capital is the city of Bari.}  In this rewritten text, the 'difficult' words are ['area', 'Apulia','region'], totalling 3 'difficult' words, which meets the specified constraint.	number_of_examples_found: 0	prompt: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are an expert in text adaptation, skilled at meticulously rewriting texts to align with requested linguistic features while preserving the original meaning.

input_src: Churchill's role in defeating the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685 helped secure James on the throne, yet just three years later he abandoned his Catholic patron for the Protestant Dutchman, William of Orange.	output: Let's break down the rewriting process step by step to meet the criteria of having no more than 3 'difficult' words.  Step 1: Identify the essential meaning of the input text The input text describes Churchill's role in helping James become king, but later switching sides to support William of Orange.  Step 2: Simplify the language while preserving the meaning To reduce the number of 'difficult' words, I'll replace them with simpler alternatives. Here's the initial rewritten text:  {Churchill helped James become king in 1685, but three years later he changed sides to support William of Orange.}  In this version, I've replaced 'defeating' with 'helped', 'Monmouth Rebellion' with a more general phrase,'secure' with a more straightforward 'become king', 'later' with 'three years later', 'abandoned' with 'changed sides', and 'patron' with no equivalent (as it's not essential to the meaning). I've also removed 'Dutchman' as it's not crucial to the meaning.  However, this rewritten text still contains 5 'difficult' words: ['Rebellion','secure', 'later', 'abandoned', 'Protestant']. We need to simplify further.  Step 3: Simplify the language further Let's replace 'Rebellion' with a more general term and rephrase the sentence to avoid 'Protestant':  {Churchill helped James become king in 1685, but then he switched to William of Orange's side.}  Now, we're down to 3 'difficult' words: ['Rebellion' is replaced,'secure' is removed, 'later' is rephrased, 'abandoned' is replaced, and 'Protestant' is removed]. The remaining 'difficult' words are ['helped', 'become', 'Orange']. This meets the criteria of having no more than 3 'difficult' words.

input_src: For example, Motacilla alba alba (often abbreviated Motacilla a. alba) is the nominate subspecies of the White Wagtail (Motacilla alba).	output: Let's break down the task step by step.  Step 1: Identify the essential meaning of the input text. The input text is describing a specific type of bird, the White Wagtail, and its subspecies.  Step 2: Identify the 'difficult' words that can be replaced. Upon reviewing the list of 'difficult' words, I noticed that 'Motacilla' appears three times. This word is a genus name and is not easily replaceable. However, I can try to reduce the number of times it appears.  Step 3: Simplify the sentence structure. I can combine the two sentences into one and remove the abbreviation, which will help reduce the number of 'difficult' words.  Step 4: Replace 'difficult' words with simpler alternatives. I can replace 'nominate subspecies' with'main type', 'abbreviated' with'shortened', and 'Wagtail' with 'bird'.  Step 5: Rewrite the sentence. Here's my first attempt: {The main type of the White bird is Motacilla alba, which is often referred to by its shortened name Motacilla.}  However, this rewritten sentence still contains 3 'difficult' words: 'Motacilla' (twice) and 'alba'.

In those days it was began to write them down."  The sentence can be broken down into two parts:  1. "They become the style we know today..." - This part describes the evolution of the style. 2. "...in ancient Athene in the 6th century B.C./O. In those days it was began to write them down." - This part provides the time and place where the style emerged.  **Step 4: Rewrite the sentence to reduce 'difficult' words** To reduce the number of 'difficult' words, we can replace 'plausibly' with a simpler word, 'probably'. We can also rephrase the second part of the sentence to avoid using 'ancient' and 'century'.  Here's the rewritten sentence: {They probably became the style we know today in a city called Athene a long time ago. At that time, people started writing them down.}  **Step 5: Verify the rewritten sentence** The rewritten sentence has only 1 'difficult' word: ['probably'].

Step 1: Identify the 'difficult' words in the input text that need to be replaced or rephrased. The 'difficult' words are ['Swilling,', 'former', 'Confederate', 'wanted', 'Jackson.']. We need to reduce the total number of 'difficult' words to 2 or less.  Step 2: Analyze the sentence structure and meaning. The sentence is about a person who wants to name a city after a general. We can simplify the sentence while preserving the original meaning.  Step 3: Replace or rephrase the 'difficult' words. Let's start by replacing 'Swilling' with a simpler name, 'John'. We can also replace 'former' with 'old' and 'wanted' with 'liked'. 'Confederate' is a crucial part of the sentence, so we'll keep it. 'Jackson' is also important, but we can rephrase it to 'the general' to make it simpler.  Step 4: Rewrite the sentence. Here's the rewritten sentence: {John, an old soldier, liked to name the city after the general Stonewall.}  In this rewritten sentence, we've reduced the number of 'difficult' words to 2: 'Confederate' and 'Stonewall'.

Step 1: Identify the 'difficult' words in the input text. The given list of 'difficult' words is: ['cases', 'Landesarbeitsgerichte', '(Superior', 'appeals', 'decisions', 'Arbeitsgerichte', '(Inferior']  Step 2: Analyze the input text and identify areas for simplification. The input text has 7 'difficult' words, and we need to maintain the original meaning while adhering to the 7-word limit.  Step 3: Simplify the text while preserving the original meaning. Let's start by replacing 'Landesarbeitsgerichte' with 'State Labour Courts' and 'Arbeitsgerichte' with 'Labour Courts'. This reduces the number of 'difficult' words.  Rewritten text: The court hears from the State Labour Courts, which, in turn, are the courts of appeal against the Labour Courts' rulings.  Step 4: Check the rewritten text for 'difficult' words.

input_src: Matilda of Flanders (c. 1031 - 2 November 1083) was the wife of William the Conqueror and, as such, Queen consort of the Kingdom of England.	output: Let's break down the task step by step.  Step 1: Identify the 'difficult' words in the input text that can be replaced with simpler alternatives.  The 'difficult' words in the input text are ['Matilda', 'Flanders', 'Conqueror', 'consort', 'England']. We need to reduce the total number of 'difficult' words to 3 or less.  Step 2: Replace 'Matilda' with a simpler alternative.  'Matilda' is a proper noun, so it's challenging to replace it with a simpler word. However, we can rephrase the sentence to focus on her relationship with William the Conqueror instead of her name.  Step 3: Replace 'Flanders' with a simpler alternative.  'Flanders' is a geographic region, and we can replace it with a more general term like 'her homeland'.  Step 4: Replace 'Conqueror' with a simpler alternative.  We can replace 'Conqueror' with 'leader', which conveys a similar meaning.  Step 5: Replace 'consort' with a simpler alternative.  'Consort' means a wife or husband of a monarch. We can replace it with 'wife'.  Step 6: Replace 'England' with a simpler alternative.  We can replace 'England' with 'the kingdom', which is a more general term.

Step 3: Replace or rephrase the 'difficult' words.  Let's replace "explored" with a simpler verb like "looked at". We can also rephrase "public opinion" to "what people think" to reduce the number of 'difficult' words.  Step 4: Rewrite the sentence while maintaining the original meaning.  Here's the rewritten sentence:  {A number of polls around the world have looked at what people think about abortion.}  In this rewritten sentence, we've reduced the number of 'difficult' words to 3: ['polls', 'abortion', 'about'].

input_src: It was mentioned for the first time in 1233 in the deed of donation by King Andrew II.	output: Let's break down the rewriting process step by step.  Step 1: Identify the 'difficult' words in the input text that need to be replaced or rephrased. The 'difficult' words are ['mentioned', 'donation', 'Andrew']. We need to reduce the total number of 'difficult' words to 1.  Step 2: Analyze the sentence structure and meaning. The sentence is stating a fact about when something was first recorded in a document. The document is a deed, and it was given by King Andrew II.  Step 3: Replace or rephrase the 'difficult' words. Let's start by replacing'mentioned' with a simpler word. We can use'recorded' or 'written'. I'll choose 'written'. The sentence becomes: It was written for the first time in 1233 in the deed of gift by King Andrew II.  We've replaced one 'difficult' word, but we still have two more to go. Let's rephrase 'donation' to something simpler. We can use 'gift', which is already done.  Now, we need to address 'Andrew'. Since it's a proper noun, we can't replace it with a simpler word. However, we can rephrase the sentence to make it less dependent on the name. We can focus on the fact that it was a king who gave the deed.  Step 4: Rewrite the sentence to meet the criteria. Here's the rewritten sentence: {It was written for the first time in 1233 in a king's gift deed.}  In this rewritten sentence, we've maintained the original meaning while reducing the total number of 'difficult' words to 1 ('written').	number_of_examples_found: 0	prompt: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are an expert in text adaptation, skilled at meticulously rewriting texts to align with requested linguistic features while preserving the original meaning.

input_src: Lepisma saccharina, frequently called silverfish, fishmoths, carpet sharks or paramites, are small, wingless insects in the order Thysanura.	output: Let's break down the task step by step.  Step 1: Identify the 'difficult' words in the input text that can be replaced with simpler alternatives.  The 'difficult' words in the input text are ['Lepisma','saccharina,', 'frequently','silverfish,', 'fishmoths,', 'wingless', 'insects', 'Thysanura.']. We need to reduce the total number of 'difficult' words to 7.  Step 2: Replace 'difficult' words with simpler alternatives.  We can replace 'frequently' with 'often', 'wingless' with 'without wings', and 'insects' with 'bugs'. These replacements reduce the total number of 'difficult' words.  Step 3: Rewrite the input text using the replaced words.  Here's the rewritten text: {These small, without wings bugs in the order Thysanura are often called silverfish, fishmoths, carpet sharks or paramites.}  However, this rewritten text still contains 8 'difficult' words: ['Lepisma' is not replaced,'saccharina,','silverfish,', 'fishmoths,', 'Thysanura.', 'carpet','sharks', 'paramites'].

input_src: It was established in the 17th century as a trading post for the British East India Company, but later grew to encompass much of western and central India, as well as parts of post-partition Pakistan and the Arabian Peninsula.	output: Let's break down the task step by step.  Step 1: Identify the 'difficult' words in the input text that can be replaced with simpler alternatives.  Upon reviewing the list of 'difficult' words, I noticed that 'trading' and 'post-partition' can be replaced with simpler words. 'Trading' can be replaced with 'business', and 'post-partition' can be replaced with 'after'.  Step 2: Rewrite the sentence to replace the identified 'difficult' words.  Here's the rewritten sentence: {It was set up in the 17th century as a business post for the British East India Company, but later grew to include much of western and central India, as well as parts of Pakistan and the Arabian Peninsula after.}  However, this rewritten sentence still contains 10 'difficult' words: ['established' (replaced with'set up'), 'century', 'business', 'India', 'later', 'encompass' (replaced with 'include'), 'central', 'India,', 'Pakistan', 'Arabian', 'Peninsula']. We need to reduce the number of 'difficult' words to 9.  Step 3: Identify additional 'difficult' words that can be replaced or rephrased.  Upon re-examining the list, I noticed that 'encompass' was replaced with 'include', but 'include' is still a bit formal. We can rephrase the sentence to use a simpler verb like 'cover'. Additionally, 'Arabian Peninsula' can be replaced with 'Arabia' to reduce the number of 'difficult' words.  Step 4: Rewrite the sentence to replace the additional 'difficult' words.  Here's the rewritten sentence: {It was set up in the 17th century as a business post for the British East India Company, but later grew to cover much of western and central India, as well as parts of Pakistan and Arabia after.}  This rewritten sentence contains 9 'difficult' words: ['set up', 'century', 'business', 'India', 'later', 'central', 'India,', 'Pakistan', 'Arabia'], meeting the specified constraint.

One way to rewrite the sentence is to replace 'variations' with a simpler word. We can use 'kinds' instead, which is a more common word.  Rewritten sentence: "Many different kinds of popularity exist, and many ways to gain it."  However, this rewritten sentence still has 3 'difficult' words: ['popularity', 'exist']. We need to reduce the number of 'difficult' words further.  Step 4: Simplify the sentence structure and wording. We can rephrase the sentence to make it simpler and more concise. We can replace 'popularity' with 'being liked', which is a more accessible concept.  Rewritten sentence: "There are many ways to be liked, and many ways to get it."  This rewritten sentence has only 1 'difficult' word: ['liked']. We can further simplify the sentence to make it even more accessible.  Step 5: Final rewrite. We can replace 'liked' with a simpler word, such as 'popular'.  Final rewritten sentence: {There are many ways to be popular, and many ways to get it.}  This rewritten sentence maintains the original meaning and has only 1 'difficult' word: ['popular'], which meets the criteria.	number_of_examples_found: 0	prompt: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are an expert in text adaptation, skilled at meticulously rewriting texts to align with requested linguistic features while preserving the original meaning.

'families' (important to describe the composition of the list)  **Step 4: Rewrite the sentence** We'll aim to retain the top 3 prioritized 'difficult' words and replace or rephrase the others.  {The list of simple groups that are finite in number consists of 18 groups that can be grouped together, plus 26 groups that are sporadic and don't follow a regular arrangement.}  **Step 5: Verify the 'difficult' word count** Let's count the 'difficult' words in the rewritten sentence: 1. 'finite' 2. 'families' (replaced with 'grouped together', not a 'difficult' word) 3.'sporadic' 4. 'consists' (replaced with 'consists', still a 'difficult' word)  We still have 4 'difficult' words. We need to reduce it to 4.  **Step 6: Refine the rewrite** Let's rephrase the sentence to replace 'consists' with a simpler word.  {The list of simple groups that are finite in number has 18 groups that can be grouped together, plus 26 groups that are sporadic and don't follow a regular arrangement.}  **Step 7: Verify the 'difficult' word count (again)** Let's count the 'difficult' words in the rewritten sentence: 1. 'finite' 2.'sporadic' 3. 'groups' (not a 'difficult' word) 4. None (we've replaced 'consists' with 'has')  We've successfully rewritten the sentence to maintain the original meaning while adhering to a total of no more than 4 'difficult' words.	number_of_examples_found: 0	prompt: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are an expert in text adaptation, skilled at meticulously rewriting texts to align with requested linguistic features while preserving the original meaning.

input_src: The Trinidad and Tobago national football team, nicknamed The Soca Warriors, is the national team of Trinidad and Tobago and is controlled by the Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation.	output: Let's break down the task step by step.  Step 1: Identify the essential meaning of the input text. The input text is describing the Trinidad and Tobago football team, its nickname, and the organization that controls it.  Step 2: Determine the most important 'difficult' word to retain. Since we can only keep one 'difficult' word, we should choose the most crucial one that still conveys the essential meaning. In this case, I'll choose 'Tobago' as it is a key part of the team's name and location.  Step 3: Rewrite the sentence to remove unnecessary 'difficult' words. We can replace 'national' with 'country's' and 'Federation' with 'association'. We can also rephrase the sentence to make it more concise.  Step 4: Ensure the rewritten sentence meets the criteria. Here's the rewritten sentence: {The football team of Trinidad and Tobago, also known as The Warriors, is the country's team and is run by the Trinidad and Tobago association.}  This rewritten sentence retains the original meaning and only includes one 'difficult' word, 'Tobago'.	number_of_examples_found: 0	prompt: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are an expert in text adaptation, skilled at meticulously rewriting texts to align with requested linguistic features while preserving the original meaning.

Step 1: Identify the 'difficult' words in the input text that need to be replaced or rephrased.  The given 'difficult' words are: ['successful', 'career', 'Quebec', 'Hockey', 'Titan,', 'drafted', 'overall)', 'Entry']  Step 2: Analyze the context and meaning of each 'difficult' word to find suitable replacements or rephrasing options.  *'successful' can be replaced with 'good' * 'career' can be rephrased as 'time playing' * 'Quebec' is a proper noun, but we can replace it with a more general term 'Canadian' to simplify the text * 'Hockey' is a sport, and we can replace it with a more general term'sports' * 'Titan' is a team name, and we can replace it with a more general term 'team' * 'drafted' can be replaced with 'picked' * 'overall' can be rephrased as 'in total' * 'Entry' can be replaced with 'draft'  Step 3: Rewrite the input text using the replaced or rephrased 'difficult' words, ensuring the original meaning is preserved.

input_src: Tolstoy and Dostoevsky in particular were titanic figures to the point that many literary critics have described one or the other as the greatest novelist ever.	output: Let's break down the task step by step.  Step 1: Identify the essential meaning of the input text. The input text is comparing two authors, Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, and stating that many literary critics consider one of them to be the greatest novelist ever.  Step 2: Identify the 'difficult' words that can be replaced or rephrased. The 'difficult' words are ['Tolstoy', 'Dostoevsky', 'particular', 'titanic', 'figures', 'literary', 'critics', 'described', 'greatest', 'novelist']. We need to reduce the total number of 'difficult' words to 6 or less.  Step 3: Replace or rephrase the 'difficult' words. Let's start by replacing 'Tolstoy' and 'Dostoevsky' with 'two famous authors', which reduces the number of 'difficult' words by 2.  Step 4: Simplify the sentence structure and wording. We can rephrase 'to the point that' to'so that' and'many literary critics have described' to'many have said'. This simplifies the sentence structure and reduces the number of 'difficult' words.  Step 5: Further simplify the sentence. We can replace 'one or the other' with 'one of them' and 'greatest novelist ever' with 'the best writer'. This reduces the number of 'difficult' words further.  Here's the rewritten sentence: {Two famous authors were so important that many have said one of them is the best writer.}  The rewritten sentence has a total of 5 'difficult' words: ['famous', 'important','many','said', 'writer']. This meets the criteria of having 6 or fewer 'difficult' words.	number_of_examples_found: 0	prompt: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "You are an expert in text adaptation, skilled at meticulously rewriting texts to align with requested linguistic features while preserving the original meaning.
