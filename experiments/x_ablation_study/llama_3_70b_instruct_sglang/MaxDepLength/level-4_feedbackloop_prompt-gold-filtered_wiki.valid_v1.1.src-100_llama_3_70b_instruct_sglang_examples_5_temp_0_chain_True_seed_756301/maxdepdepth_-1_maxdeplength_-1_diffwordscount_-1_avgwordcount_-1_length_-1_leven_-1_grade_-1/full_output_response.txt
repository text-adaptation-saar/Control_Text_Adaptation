I apologize for the mistake. Here is the revised rewritten sentence(s) with a maximum dependency length of exactly 2:  {Bari is a province. It is in Apulia. It is in Italy. Its capital is Bari.}  Here's the explanation for each rewritten sentence:  1. "Bari is a province." - This sentence has a maximum dependency length of 2, as "is" connects "Bari" to "a province". 2. "It is in Apulia." - This sentence has a maximum dependency length of 2, as "is" connects "it" to "in Apulia". 3. "It is in Italy." - This sentence has a maximum dependency length of 2, as "is" connects "it" to "in Italy". 4. "Its capital is Bari." - This sentence has a maximum dependency length of 2, as "is" connects "Its capital" to "Bari".  By breaking down the original text into these four simpler sentences, I was able to maintain the original meaning while adhering to the maximum dependency length of exactly 2.
