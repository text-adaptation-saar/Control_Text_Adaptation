To rewrite the input text to maintain its original meaning while strictly adhering to a maximum dependency length of exactly 2, I will break down the text into simpler sentences and rephrase them to meet the dependency length requirement.  Rewritten sentence(s): {The Province of Bari is a province. It is in Apulia, Italy. Its capital is Bari.}  Here's the explanation for each rewritten sentence:  1. "The Province of Bari is a province." - This sentence has a maximum dependency length of 2, as "is" connects "Province of Bari" to "a province". 2. "It is in Apulia, Italy." - This sentence has a maximum dependency length of 2, as "is" connects "it" to "in Apulia, Italy". 3. "Its capital is Bari." - This sentence has a maximum dependency length of 2, as "is" connects "Its capital" to "Bari".  By breaking down the original text into these three simpler sentences, I was able to maintain the original meaning while adhering to the maximum dependency length of exactly 2.

To rewrite the input text while adhering to a maximum dependency length of exactly 8, I will break down the original sentence into smaller, simpler sentences. Here's the rewritten text:  {(Mercury has a freezing point of -38.83 Â°C.) (Its boiling point is 356.73 Â°C.) (Mercury has one of the broadest liquid state ranges of any metal.)}  Here's the explanation for each rewritten sentence:  1. (Mercury has a freezing point of -38.83 Â°C.) * This sentence focuses on the freezing point of mercury, keeping the dependency length within the limit of 8. 2.
