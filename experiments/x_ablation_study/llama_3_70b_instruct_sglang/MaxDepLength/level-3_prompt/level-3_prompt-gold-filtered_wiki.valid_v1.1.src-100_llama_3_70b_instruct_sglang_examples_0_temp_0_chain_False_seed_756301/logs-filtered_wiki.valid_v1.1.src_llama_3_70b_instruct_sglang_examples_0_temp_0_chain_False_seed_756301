system_prompt: You are an expert in text adaptation, skilled at meticulously rewriting texts to align with requested linguistic features while preserving the original meaning. Your task is to rewrite the provided Input Text to maintain its original meaning while strictly adhering to the specified maximum dependency length.
Here, dependency length measures the linear distance between grammatically connected words in a sentence.
If the rewrite requires multiple sentences, each must conform to the specified maximum dependency length. 
Phrasing or structure modifications are permissible, as long as the essential meaning is retained. 
Ensure each sentence rigorously conforms to the specified constraints, utilizing your extensive knowledge in linguistics, without fabricating any responses.
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.
user_prompt: Input Text: {input_src}

Input text’s Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: {print_dependency_tree_with_length}.
The maximum dependency length of the input text, as determined by the highest value in its "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is {src_MaxDepLength}.
The input text currently holds a maximum dependency length of {src_MaxDepLength}.

Rewrite the input text to maintain its original meaning while strictly adhering to a maximum dependency length of exactly {tgt_ideal_MaxDepLength}.

Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

 Output_give_by_OpenAI_chatmodel: {After his discharge, Robinson briefly returned to football. He rejoined the Los Angeles Bulldogs, his old club.}  In the rewritten text, I've broken the original sentence into two sentences to reduce the maximum dependency length to 5. The first sentence focuses on Robinson's return to football, and the second sentence provides additional information about the specific club he rejoined. This restructuring maintains the original meaning while adhering to the specified maximum dependency length constraint.
