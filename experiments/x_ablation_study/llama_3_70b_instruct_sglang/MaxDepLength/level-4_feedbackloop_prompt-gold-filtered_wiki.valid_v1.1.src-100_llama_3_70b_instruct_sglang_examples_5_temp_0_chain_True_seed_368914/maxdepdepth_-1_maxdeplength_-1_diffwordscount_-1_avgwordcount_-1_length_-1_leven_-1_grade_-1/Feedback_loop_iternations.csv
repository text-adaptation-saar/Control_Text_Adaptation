(It has one of the broadest liquid state ranges among metals.)}  Here's the explanation for each rewritten sentence:  1. (Mercury has a freezing point of -38.83 Â°C and a boiling point of 356.73 Â°C.) * This sentence combines the information about the freezing and boiling points of mercury, keeping the dependency length within the limit of 8. 2. (It has one of the broadest liquid state ranges among metals.) * This sentence conveys the main idea of mercury having a broad range of liquid state, while keeping the dependency length within the limit of 8.  I hope this revised rewritten sentence(s) meet the requirements.

After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to meet the exact maximum dependency length of 2 while maintaining the original meaning. The sentence structure and word choice are crucial in determining the dependency length.
