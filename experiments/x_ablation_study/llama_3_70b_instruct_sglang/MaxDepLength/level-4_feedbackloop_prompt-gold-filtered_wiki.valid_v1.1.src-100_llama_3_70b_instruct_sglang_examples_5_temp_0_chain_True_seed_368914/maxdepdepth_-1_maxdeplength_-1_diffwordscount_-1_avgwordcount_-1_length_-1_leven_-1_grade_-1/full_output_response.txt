I apologize for the mistake. Here is the revised rewritten sentence:  Summary of compliance with rewriting criteria: Rewritten sentence(s): {Bertsch is a student. Bertsch sets it up.} Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency length = maximum value in "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max(["(0, 'is') [(1, 'Bertsch') (2, 'a') (3,'student')]", "(0,'sets') [(1, 'Bertsch') (2, 'it') (3, 'up')]"]) = 3 The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency length of exactly 3, which is still not meeting the requirement.  After re-examining the sentence, I realized that it's challenging to rewrite the sentence to meet the exact maximum dependency length of 2 while maintaining the original meaning. The sentence structure and word choice are crucial in determining the dependency length.  If you could provide more context or relax the constraint, I'd be happy to assist you in rewriting the sentence to better meet your requirements.
