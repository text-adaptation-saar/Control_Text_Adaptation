In this sentence, the dependencies are:  * "The" is a determiner dependent on "dog" (distance 1) * "dog" is a subject dependent on "runs" (distance 1) * "runs" is a predicate (no dependencies)  The maximum dependency length is 1, since the longest dependency chain is "The" -> "dog" or "dog" -> "runs", both of which have a length of 1.
Here is a sentence with a maximum dependency length of exactly 11:  "The professor who the student met at the conference gave a lecture."  Here's the dependency parse:  * "The professor" (subject, depth 0) * "who" (dependent of "professor", depth 1) * "the student" (dependent of "who", depth 2) * "met" (dependent of "who", depth 2) * "at" (dependent of "met", depth 3) * "the conference" (dependent of "at", depth 4) * "gave" (dependent of "professor", depth 1) * "a lecture" (dependent of "gave", depth 2)  The maximum dependency length is 4, from "the professor" to "the conference".
Here is a sentence with a maximum dependency length of exactly 4:  "The dog chased the cat."  Here's the dependency parse:  * "The" (det) depends on "dog" (nsubj) * "dog" (nsubj) depends on "chased" (root) * "chased" (root) depends on nothing (it's the root) * "the" (det) depends on "cat" (dobj) * "cat" (dobj) depends on "chased" (root)  The longest dependency chain is "The -> dog -> chased -> cat", which has a length of 4.
