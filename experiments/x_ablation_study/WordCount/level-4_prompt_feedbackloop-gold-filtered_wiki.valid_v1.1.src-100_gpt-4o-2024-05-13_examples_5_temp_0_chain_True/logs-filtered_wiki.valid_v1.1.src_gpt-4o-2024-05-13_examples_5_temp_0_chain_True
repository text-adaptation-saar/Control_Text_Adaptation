system_prompt: You are an expert in text adaptation, skilled at meticulously rewriting texts to align with requested linguistic features while preserving the original meaning. Your task is to rewrite the provided Input Text to maintain its original meaning while strictly adhering to the specified number of word count. 
Here, word count is the total number of words in a sentence, defined by sequences of characters separated by whitespace. 

If the rewrite requires multiple sentences, each must conform to the specified word count. 
Phrasing or structure modifications are permissible, as long as the essential meaning is retained. 
Ensure each sentence rigorously conforms to the specified constraints, utilizing your extensive knowledge in linguistics, without fabricating any responses.
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.
user_prompt: Input Text: {input_src}

Input text total words list: {print_word_list}.
The number of sentences in the input text is: {no_of_sentences}.
The average word count per sentence is calculated by dividing the total word count by the number of sentences in the input text, resulting {src_WordCount} words.
The input text currently holds word count of {src_WordCount}.

Rewrite the Input text to maintain its original meaning, but strictly using {tgt_ideal_WordCount} words in each output sentence:"

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Let's think through this step by step. Solve each step and explain how you arrived at your answer. 
Always output all the rewritten sentence(s) within one curly brace.
output_prompt: Summary of compliance with rewriting criteria:
Total words in the rewritten sentence: {print_word_list}.
Number of sentences in the rewritten sentence: {no_of_sentences}.
The average word count per sentence is calculated by dividing the total word count by the number of sentences in the rewritten sentence, resulting in an average of {tgt_ideal_WordCount} words per sentence. This meets the requested word count of exactly {tgt_ideal_WordCount}.

Rewritten sentence(s): {{output_text}}

Rewritten sentence(s): {{output_text}}
The generated Rewritten sentence(s) word count = len({print_word_list}) = {src_WordCount}
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold {src_WordCount} words.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested word count of exactly {tgt_ideal_WordCount}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence strictly using {tgt_ideal_WordCount} words in each output sentence. 

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

 Output_give_by_OpenAI_chatmodel: To meet the requirement of strictly using 16 words in the rewritten sentence while maintaining the original meaning, I will carefully adjust the sentence again.  Original sentence: "Like the cakes, coconut flavor is not always a must in the frosting."  Expanded sentence to meet the 16-word requirement: "Similar to the cakes, coconut flavor is not always a necessary ingredient in the frosting recipe."  Summary of compliance with rewriting criteria: Total words in the rewritten sentence: ['Similar', 'to', 'the', 'cakes,', 'coconut', 'flavor', 'is', 'not', 'always', 'a', 'necessary', 'ingredient', 'in', 'the', 'frosting', 'recipe.']. Number of sentences in the rewritten sentence: 1. The average word count per sentence is calculated by dividing the total word count by the number of sentences in the rewritten sentence, resulting in an average of 16 words per sentence. This meets the requested word count of exactly 16.  Rewritten sentence(s): {Similar to the cakes, coconut flavor is not always a necessary ingredient in the frosting recipe.}

The generated Rewritten sentence(s) word count = len({print_word_list}) = {src_WordCount}
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold {src_WordCount} words.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested word count of exactly {tgt_ideal_WordCount}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence strictly using {tgt_ideal_WordCount} words in each output sentence. 

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met.

Rewritten sentence(s): {{output_text}}
The generated Rewritten sentence(s) word count = len({print_word_list}) = {src_WordCount}
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold {src_WordCount} words.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested word count of exactly {tgt_ideal_WordCount}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence strictly using {tgt_ideal_WordCount} words in each output sentence. 

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.

The generated Rewritten sentence(s) word count = len({print_word_list}) = {src_WordCount}
The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold {src_WordCount} words.
Unfortunately, rewritten sentence(s) do not align with the requested word count of exactly {tgt_ideal_WordCount}.


To ensure clarity and meet specific requirements, kindly revise the sentence strictly using {tgt_ideal_WordCount} words in each output sentence. 

Please note, that if the initial rewrite does not meet these specific requirements, you are encouraged to modify and regenerate the output until the criteria are satisfactorily met. 
Always output all Rewritten sentence(s) within curly braces.
