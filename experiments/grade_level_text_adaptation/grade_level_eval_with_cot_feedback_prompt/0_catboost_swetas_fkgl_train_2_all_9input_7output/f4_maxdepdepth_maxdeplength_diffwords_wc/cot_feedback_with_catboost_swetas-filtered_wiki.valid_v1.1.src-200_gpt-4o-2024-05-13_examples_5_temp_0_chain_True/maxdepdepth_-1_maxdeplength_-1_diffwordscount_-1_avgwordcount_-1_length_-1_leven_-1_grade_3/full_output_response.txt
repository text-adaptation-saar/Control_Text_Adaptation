To meet the specified criteria, we need to simplify the sentence structure while maintaining the original meaning. Here’s the step-by-step process:  1. **Maximum Depth of Dependency Tree of Exactly 2**: This means we need to keep the sentence structure very simple, with no more than two levels of hierarchical relationships. 2. **Maximum Dependency Length of Exactly 3**: This means the linear distance between grammatically connected words should not exceed three. 3. **No More Than 1 'Difficult' Word**: We need to limit the use of complex words. 4. **Exact Word Count of 6 for Each Sentence**: Each sentence must contain exactly six words.  Given these constraints, here is the rewritten text:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Clark mailed photos. He said, "Piltdown shades."}  Explanation: - **Maximum Depth of Dependency Tree**: The depth is 2, as "Clark" is the subject, "mailed" is the verb, and "photos" is the object.
