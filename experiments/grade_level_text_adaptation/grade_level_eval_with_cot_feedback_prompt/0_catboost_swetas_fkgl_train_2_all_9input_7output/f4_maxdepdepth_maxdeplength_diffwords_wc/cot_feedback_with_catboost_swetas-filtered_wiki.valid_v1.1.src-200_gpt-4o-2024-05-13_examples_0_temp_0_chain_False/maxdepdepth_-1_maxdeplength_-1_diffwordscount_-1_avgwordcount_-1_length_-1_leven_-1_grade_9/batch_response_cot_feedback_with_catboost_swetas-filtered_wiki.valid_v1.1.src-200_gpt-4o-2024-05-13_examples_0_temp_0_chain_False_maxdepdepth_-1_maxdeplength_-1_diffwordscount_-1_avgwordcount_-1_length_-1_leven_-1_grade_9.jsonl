We can achieve this by rephrasing.\n\n4. **Maintaining Dependency Constraints**:\n   - We need to ensure the maximum depth of the dependency tree is 3 and the maximum dependency length is 5.\n\n### Rewritten Sentence:\n\n- **Rephrased Sentence**: \"People were affected by the earthquake event on 8 October 2005.\"\n\n- **Analysis**:\n  - Word Count: 11 words\n  - Difficult Words: affected, earthquake, event (3 words)\n  - Dependency Depth: 3\n  - Dependency Length: 5\n\n### Final Output:\n\n```{People were affected by the earthquake event on 8 October 2005.}```"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 906, "completion_tokens": 417, "total_tokens": 1323}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_319be4768e"}}, "error": null}
