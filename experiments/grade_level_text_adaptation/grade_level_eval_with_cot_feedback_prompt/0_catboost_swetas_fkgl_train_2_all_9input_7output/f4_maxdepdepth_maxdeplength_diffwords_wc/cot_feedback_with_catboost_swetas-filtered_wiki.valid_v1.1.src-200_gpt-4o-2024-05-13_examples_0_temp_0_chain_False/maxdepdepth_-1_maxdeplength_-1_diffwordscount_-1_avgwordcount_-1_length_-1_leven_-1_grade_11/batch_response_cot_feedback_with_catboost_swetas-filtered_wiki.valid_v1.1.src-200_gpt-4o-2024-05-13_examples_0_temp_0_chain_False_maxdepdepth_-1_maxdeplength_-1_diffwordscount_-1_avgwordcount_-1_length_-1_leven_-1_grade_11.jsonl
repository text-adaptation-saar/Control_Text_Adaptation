We can add necessary details to meet the word count requirement.\n\n### Final Rewritten Sentences:\n\n1. **First Sentence**: \"Red blood cells, also called erythrocytes, are the most common type of blood cell in vertebrates. They are crucial for health.\"\n   - **Word Count**: 21\n   - **Difficult Words**: 4 ('erythrocytes', 'common', 'vertebrates', 'crucial')\n\n2. **Second Sentence**: \"They deliver oxygen to body tissues through blood flow in the circulatory system, ensuring that all parts of the body get oxygen.\"\n   - **Word Count**: 21\n   - **Difficult Words**: 3 ('oxygen', 'circulatory', 'ensuring')\n\n### Final Output:\n\n```{ \"Red blood cells, also called erythrocytes, are the most common type of blood cell in vertebrates. They are crucial for health.\", \"They deliver oxygen to body tissues through blood flow in the circulatory system, ensuring that all parts of the body get oxygen.\" }```\n\nThis rewrite maintains the original meaning while adhering to the specified constraints:\n- **Maximum Depth of Dependency Tree**: 6\n- **Maximum Dependency Length**: 9\n- **Total 'Difficult' Words**: 7\n- **Word Count per Sentence**: 21"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1372, "completion_tokens": 688, "total_tokens": 2060}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_319be4768e"}}, "error": null}
