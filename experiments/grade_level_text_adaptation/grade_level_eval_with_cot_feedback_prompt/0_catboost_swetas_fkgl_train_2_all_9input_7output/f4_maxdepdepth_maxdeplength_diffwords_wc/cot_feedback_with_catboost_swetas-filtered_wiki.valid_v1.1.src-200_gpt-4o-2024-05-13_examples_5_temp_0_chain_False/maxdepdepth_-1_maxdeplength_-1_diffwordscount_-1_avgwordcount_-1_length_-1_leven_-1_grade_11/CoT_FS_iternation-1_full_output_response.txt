Let's rewrite the sentence to meet these criteria:  **Original Sentence**: "These movement patterns are distinct to the taxa, separating them."  **Rewritten Sentence**: "These unique movement patterns are distinct to the taxa, clearly separating them."  **Analysis**: - **Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree**: ['(0, are)(1, patterns)(2, These) (2, unique) (2, movement) (1, distinct)(2, to)(3, taxa)(4, the) (1, ,) (1, clearly)(2, separating)(3, them) (1, .)'] - The maximum depth is 4. - **Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree**: ["(0, 'are') [(1, 'patterns') [(2, 'These') (1, 'unique') (1, 'movement')] (1, 'distinct') [(1, 'to') [(2, 'taxa') [(1, 'the')]]] (6, 'clearly') [(1, 'separating') [(1, 'them')]]]"] - The maximum dependency length is 6. - **Difficult Words**: ['movement', 'patterns', 'distinct', 'separating', 'unique']. - The total number of difficult words is 5. - **Word Count**: ['These', 'unique', 'movement', 'patterns', 'are', 'distinct', 'to', 'the', 'taxa,', 'clearly', 'separating', 'them.'] - The total word count is 12.  Rewritten sentence(s): {These unique movement patterns are distinct to the taxa, clearly separating them.}
