I apologize for the mistake. Here is the revised rewritten sentence that meets the criteria:  Rewritten sentence(s): {The Province of Bari is a province in the region of Apulia. Its capital is the city of Bari with beautiful architecture.}  (1) Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max(['(0, is)(1, Province)(2, The) (2, of)(3, Bari) (1, province)(2, in)(3, region)(4, Apulia) (1,.)', '(0, is)(1, capital)(2, Its) (1, city)(2, the) (2, of)(3, Bari)(4, with) (5, architecture) (1,.)']) = 5.
