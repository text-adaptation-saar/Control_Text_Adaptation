(2) Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency length = maximum value in "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max(["(0, 'differs') [(1, 'Austro-Bavarian') (1, 'from') [(2, 'German') [(1, 'Standard')]] (6,'making') [(1, 'native') (2,'speakers') (1,'struggle')]]"]) = 6. The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency length of exactly 6.  (3) Identified 'difficult' words in generated Rewritten sentence(s) = len(['Austro-Bavarian', 'differs', 'Standard', 'German', 'native']) = 5. The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold total of 5 'difficult' words.  (4) Total words in the generated rewritten sentence(s): ['Austro-Bavarian', 'differs', 'from', 'Standard', 'German','making', 'native','speakers','struggle', 'it', 'hard', 'for']. Number of sentences in the rewritten sentence: 1. The average word count per sentence is calculated by dividing the total word count by the number of sentences in the rewritten sentence, resulting in an average of 11 words per sentence.  I hope this revised sentence meets the specified criteria.

(2) Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency length = maximum value in "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max(["(0, 'finds') [(3, 'Today') (1, 'it') (2, 'expression') [(1, 'its') (1, 'in') [(3, 'form') [(2, 'a') (1, 'humorous')]]] (7, 'during') [(1, 'the') (1, 'Karneval')] (9, 'and') (10, 'in') [(1,'sports') (1, 'too')]]"]) = 10 The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency length of 10, which is close to the requested value of 9. I will try to revise it further to meet the exact requirement.  (3) Identified 'difficult' words in generated Rewritten sentence(s) = len(['expression', 'humorous']) = 2. The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a total of 2 'difficult' words, which is less than the requested maximum of 3.  (4) Total words in the generated rewritten sentence(s): ['Today,', 'it', 'finds', 'its', 'expression', 'in', 'a', 'humorous', 'form', 'during', 'the', 'Karneval', 'and', 'in','sports', 'too.'] Number of sentences in the rewritten sentence: 1. The average word count per sentence is calculated by dividing the total word count by the number of sentences in the rewritten sentence, resulting in an average of 15 words per sentence, which meets the requested word count.  I hope this revised attempt meets the criteria. If not, I will continue to revise until the requirements are met.

(2) Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency length = maximum value in "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max(["(0,'removed') [(6, 'However') (3,'member') [(1, 'one')] (2, 'will') (1, 'be') (1, 'from') [(3, 'tribe') [(2, 'the') (1, 'winning')]] (8, 'given') [(4, 'to') (2, 'them')] (4, 'before') (2,'reward') [(1, 'the')] (1, 'is')]]"]) = 8 The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency length of exactly 8.  (3) Identified 'difficult' words in generated Rewritten sentence(s) = len(['removed', 'winning','reward']) = 3. The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold total of 3 'difficult' words.

The average word count per sentence is calculated by dividing the total word count by the number of sentences in the rewritten sentence, resulting in an average of 15 words per sentence.  I hope this revised attempt meets the criteria.

(2) Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency length = maximum value in "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max(["(0,'said') [(1, 'Gillard') (1, 'in') [(1, '2010')] (5, 'believe') [(2, 'I') (1, 'do') (1, 'n't') (1, 'in') [(1, 'God')] (3, 'and') (5, ''m') [(1, 'I') (1, 'not') (2,'religious')]]]]) = 7 The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency length of exactly 7.  (3) Identified 'difficult' words in generated Rewritten sentence(s) = len(['Gillard', 'believe','religious']) = 3. The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold total of 3 'difficult' words.  (4) Total words in the generated rewritten sentence(s): ['Gillard','said', 'in', '2010,', '"I', "don't", 'believe', 'in', 'God,', 'and', "I'm", 'not','religious.'] Number of sentences in the rewritten sentence: 1. The average word count per sentence is calculated by dividing the total word count by the number of sentences in the rewritten sentence, resulting in an average of 14 words per sentence.  The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency depth of 4, maximum dependency length of 7, 'difficult' words of 3, and word count of 14.

The rewritten sentence(s) now meet all the requested criteria.
line_number, 199, iternation, 5, response, I apologize for the mistake. Here is a revised attempt at rewriting the sentence to meet the specified criteria:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Marguerite Louise, daughter of Gaston de France, was obliged to surrender her rights as Princess of France in Cosimo's contract.}  Here's the breakdown of how this rewritten sentence meets the criteria:  (1) Maximum dependency depth: The maximum dependency depth of this sentence is 6, which meets the requirement.  (2) Maximum dependency length: The maximum dependency length of this sentence is 10, which meets the requirement.  (3) 'Difficult' words: The 'difficult' words in this sentence are ['Marguerite', 'Gaston', 'Cosimo', 'contract'], which totals 4 'difficult' words, meeting the requirement.  (4) Word count: The total word count of this sentence is 19, which meets the requirement.  I hope this revised sentence meets the specified criteria.
