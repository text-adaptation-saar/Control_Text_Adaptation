Here is a revised attempt at rewriting the sentence to meet the criteria:  Rewritten sentence(s): {The Greek Patriarchate is in Alexandria, distinct from Coptic.}  Here's the breakdown of compliance with the rewriting criteria:  (1) Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max(['(0, is)(1, The) (1, Patriarchate)(2, the) (2, Greek) (1, in)(2, Alexandria)(3,,) (2, distinct)(3, from)(4, Coptic) (1,.)']) = 4.
