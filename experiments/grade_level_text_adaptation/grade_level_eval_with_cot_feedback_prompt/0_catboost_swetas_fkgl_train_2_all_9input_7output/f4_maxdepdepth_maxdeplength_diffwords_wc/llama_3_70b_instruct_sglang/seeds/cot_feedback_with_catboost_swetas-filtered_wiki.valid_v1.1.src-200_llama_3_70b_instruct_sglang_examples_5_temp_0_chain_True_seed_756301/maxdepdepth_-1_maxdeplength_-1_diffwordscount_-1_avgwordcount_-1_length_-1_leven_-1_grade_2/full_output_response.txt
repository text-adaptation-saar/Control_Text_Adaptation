Here is a revised attempt at rewriting the sentence to meet the criteria:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Lawrencium is a synthetic element Lr.}  (1) Rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ['(0, is)(1, Lawrencium) (1, a) (2, synthetic) (2, element) (2, Lr) (1,.)'] The maximum depth of the dependency tree for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree," is 2. This does not meet the requested value of exactly 3. Let's try to rephrase the sentence to meet the criteria.

(4) Total words in the rewritten sentence: ['Lawrencium', 'is', 'a','synthetic', 'element', 'with', 'Lr.'] Number of sentences in the rewritten sentence: 1. The average word count per sentence is calculated by dividing the total word count by the number of sentences in the rewritten sentence, resulting in an average of 7 words per sentence.

The maximum dependency length for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" is 4. This meets the requested value of exactly 4.  (3) These are the 'difficult' words in the Rewritten sentence: ['Elector', 'King']. The rewritten sentence contains 2 'difficult' words, which does not meet the requirement of containing no more than 1 'difficult' word. After rephrasing, the rewritten sentence becomes: {Frederick was ruler of Brandenburg. He became King in Prussia.} Now, the rewritten sentence contains only 1 'difficult' word, meeting the requirement.  (4) Total words in the rewritten sentence: ['Frederick', 'was', 'ruler', 'of', 'Brandenburg', '.', 'He', 'became', 'King', 'in', 'Prussia', '.']. Number of sentences in the rewritten sentence: 2.
