(2) Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency length = maximum value in "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max(["(0, 'contributed') [(7, 'While') (3,'many') (1, 'philosophers') (1, 'are') (1, 'practitioners')] (2,'some') [(2, 'prominent') (1,'scientists')] (1, 'have') (1, 'to') [(2, 'field') [(1, 'the')]] (4, 'and') (6, 'do') [(1,'still')]]"]) = 7 The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency length of exactly 7.  (3) Identified 'difficult' words in generated Rewritten sentence(s) = len(['philosophers', 'practitioners', 'prominent', 'contributed','scientists']) = 5. The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold total of 5 'difficult' words.

Number of sentences in the rewritten sentence: 1. The average word count per sentence is calculated by dividing the total word count by the number of sentences in the rewritten sentence, resulting in an average of 14 words per sentence.  I hope this revised attempt meets the specified criteria.
