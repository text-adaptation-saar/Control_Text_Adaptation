I apologize for the mistake. Here is the revised rewritten sentence that meets the criteria:  Rewritten sentence(s): {The Province of Bari is a province in the region of Apulia. Its capital is the city of Bari with beautiful architecture.}  (1) Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max(['(0, is)(1, Province)(2, The) (2, of)(3, Bari) (1, province)(2, in)(3, region)(4, Apulia) (1,.)', '(0, is)(1, capital)(2, Its) (1, city)(2, the) (2, of)(3, Bari)(4, with) (5, architecture) (1,.)']) = 5.

I apologize for the mistake. Here is a revised attempt at rewriting the sentence to meet the specified criteria:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Scrooge, the richest duck, constantly tries to find ways to increase his wealth.}  Here's the breakdown of how this rewritten sentence meets the criteria:  (1) Maximum dependency depth: The rewritten sentence's Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree is ['(0, tries)(1, Scrooge)(2, the) (2, richest) (2, duck)(3, constantly) (3, to) (3, find)(4, ways)(5, to) (5, increase)(6, his) (6, wealth) (1,.)'].
