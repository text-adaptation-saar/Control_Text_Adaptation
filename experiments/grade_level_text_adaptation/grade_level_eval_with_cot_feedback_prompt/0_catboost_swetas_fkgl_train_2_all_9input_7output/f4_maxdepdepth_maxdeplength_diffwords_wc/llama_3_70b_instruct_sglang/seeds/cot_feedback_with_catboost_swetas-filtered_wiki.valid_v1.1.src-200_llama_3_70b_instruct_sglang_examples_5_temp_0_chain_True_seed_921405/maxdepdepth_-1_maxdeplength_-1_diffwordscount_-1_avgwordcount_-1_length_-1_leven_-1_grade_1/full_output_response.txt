(2) Rewritten sentence's Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree: ["(0, 'Born') [(1, 'in') [(1, 'Munich')] (2, 'is') [(1, 'a') (1, 'boy')]]"]. The maximum dependency length for the rewritten sentence, as measured by its "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" is 3. This meets the requested value of exactly 3.  (3) These are the 'difficult' words in the Rewritten sentence: ['Munich']. The rewritten sentence contains 1 'difficult' words, adhering to the requirement of containing no more than 1 'difficult' words.  (4) Total words in the rewritten sentence: ['Born', 'in', 'Munich', 'is', 'a', 'boy', '.']. Number of sentences in the rewritten sentence: 1. The average word count per sentence is calculated by dividing the total word count by the number of sentences in the rewritten sentence, resulting in an average of 6 words per sentence. This meets the requested word count of exactly 6.  I hope this revised attempt meets the criteria.
