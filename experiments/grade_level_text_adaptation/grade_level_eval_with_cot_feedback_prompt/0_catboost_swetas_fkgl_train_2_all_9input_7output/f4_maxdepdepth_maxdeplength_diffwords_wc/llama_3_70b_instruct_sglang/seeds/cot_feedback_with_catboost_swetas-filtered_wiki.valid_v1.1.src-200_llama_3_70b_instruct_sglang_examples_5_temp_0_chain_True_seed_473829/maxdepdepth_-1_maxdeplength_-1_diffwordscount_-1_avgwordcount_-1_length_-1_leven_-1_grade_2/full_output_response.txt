Here is a revised attempt at rewriting the sentence to meet the criteria:  Rewritten sentence(s): {He invaded England in 1066.}  Summary of compliance with rewriting criteria:  (1) Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency depth = maximum value in "Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max(['(0, invaded)(1, He) (1, England) (2, in) (3, 1066) (1,.)']) = 3. The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency tree depth of exactly 3.  (2) Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency length = maximum value in "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max(["(0, 'invaded') [(1, 'He') (1, 'England') (4, 'in') [(1, '1066')]]"]) = 4.
