Here is a revised attempt at rewriting the sentence to meet the specified criteria:  Rewritten sentence(s): {Uncle Tom's Cabin has had a significant influence, equaled by few other novels, in history.}  Here's the breakdown of how this rewritten sentence meets the criteria:  (1) Maximum dependency depth: The Depth-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree for this sentence is ["(0, had)(1, Cabin)(2, Tom)(3, Uncle) (3,'s) (1, has) (1, influence)(2, a) (2, significant) (2, equaled)(3, by)(4, few) (4, other) (4, novels) (4, in)(5, history) (1,.)"]. The maximum depth is 6, which meets the requirement.  (2) Maximum dependency length: The Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree for this sentence is ["(0, 'had') [(2, 'Cabin') [(2, 'Tom') [(1, 'Uncle') (1, ''s')]] (1, 'has') (2, 'influence') [(1, 'a') (1,'significant') (1, 'equaled') [(1, 'by') [(4, 'few') (1, 'other') (1, 'novels') (1, 'in') [(1, 'history')]]]]]]"]. The maximum dependency length is 4, which meets the requirement.  (3) Total 'difficult' words: The 'difficult' words in this sentence are ['significant', 'influence', 'novels'], which totals 3, meeting the requirement.  (4) Word count: The total word count is 13, which meets the requirement.  I hope this revised sentence meets all the specified criteria.

(2) Rewritten sentence's maximum dependency length = maximum value in "Length-Indexed Linearized Dependency Tree" = max(["(0,'said') [(1, 'Le') (1, 'Gros') (1, 'Clark')] (1, 'casually') (3, 'Shades') [(1, 'of') [(1, 'Piltdown')]]]"]) = 4 The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold a maximum dependency length of exactly 4.  (3) Identified 'difficult' words in generated Rewritten sentence(s) = len(['casually', 'Shades', 'Piltdown.', 'Gros']) = 4. The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold total of 4 'difficult' words.  (4) Total words in the generated rewritten sentence(s): ['Le', 'Gros', 'Clark','said', 'casually', '"Shades', 'of', 'Piltdown."']. Number of sentences in the rewritten sentence: 1. The average word count per sentence is calculated by dividing the total word count by the number of sentences in the rewritten sentence, resulting in an average of 9 words per sentence.  I hope this revised attempt meets the criteria.

(3) Identified 'difficult' words in generated Rewritten sentence(s) = len(['Munich,', 'Baader', 'criminal', 'involvement', 'Faction']) = 5. The rewritten sentence(s) currently hold total of 5 'difficult' words.  (4) Total words in the generated rewritten sentence(s): ['Born', 'in', 'Munich,', 'Baader', 'was', 'a', 'high','school', 'dropout', 'and', 'criminal', 'before', 'his', 'involvement', 'in', 'the', 'Red', 'Army', 'Faction']. Number of sentences in the rewritten sentence: 1. The average word count per sentence is calculated by dividing the total word count by the number of sentences in the rewritten sentence, resulting in an average of 19 words per sentence.  The rewritten sentence(s) now meet all the requested criteria.
